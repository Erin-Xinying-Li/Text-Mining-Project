0,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"Rich gold in color. Broad, layered aromas of very ripe fruit with hints of sweet smoke, brown sugar, honey and a savory earthy minerality. Full-bodied, bone dry, but richly textured with crisp acidity and a wide palette of flavors, ripe stone fruit, a creamy savory earthiness, sage and a balsamic kick on the finish. Very long length, slightly warm but with a lingering savory, mineral finish.",90,84.0
1,Testarossa,"Cooked cranberry is spiced with anise, peppercorn and roasted beef slices on this bottling from a vineyard planted by three brothers who are longtime Salinas Valley farmers. The palate shows dark cranberry and raspberry, spiced up by chopped sage, thyme and bay leaf.",91,64.0
2,Robert Mondavi,"Pithy, with grapefruit and lemon peel flavors, this wine is deceptively crisp and light on the nose, offering a wealth of body and lushness on the palate, accented with nutmeg and peach. It includes 4% Sémillon, partly from the winery's beloved To Kalon vineyard.",90,20.0
3,Testarossa,"Overly sweet and simple, and something of a disappointment given the winery's past performance, this Syrah tastes like melted cherry jam, stirred with chocolate pie filling and sprinkled with fennel and pepper.",85,49.0
4,Robert Mondavi,"With rich, sweet blackberry and cocoa flavors, this is a very nice Cabernet for drinking with a good meal. It's a little rough around the edges, with jaggy tannins. Ready now.",87,28.0
5,Louis Latour,"This beautiful, rich wine has yellow fruits and is concentrated, tightly textured and conveys a ripe character. The touches of wood are just right, adding spice to the opulent fruitiness. A mineral texture gives some tightness to the aftertaste. Drink from 2024.",96,630.0
6,Louis Latour,"This is an opulent wine from one of the fabled series of white Grand Crus. Along with generous yellow fruits and ripe citrus, it has weight and gravitas. Spice from the wood fills things out even more, giving the wine its balance, its intensity and its future. Drink from 2022.",95,380.0
7,Undurraga,"Smooth smelling, with pure and fresh berry and plum aromas. Very young and a bit tangy on the palate, with cherry and berry flavors and an oaky, soft finish that goes sweet then sour, and lasts for a long time. In terms of structure, it's balanced, mildly tannic, yet meant for drinking now.",87,12.0
8,Robert Mondavi,"Fine acidity and a bracing minerality, like a lick of cold steel on a winter day, mark this Chardonnay. It has oak notes, but they're wisely kept in the background, allowing the citrus, green apple and peach flavors to star. This beautiful wine continues the winery's string of great reserve Chardonnays, and is their best since the 2006 vintage.",92,40.0
9,Chehalem,"Proving that exceptional wines can be (and were) made in this cool, light vintage, this estate-grown selection is both elegant and complex. Flavors of mixed wild berries, a streak of tea, a whiff of peach and compelling balance carry it through an extended finish.",92,50.0
10,Chehalem,"A marvelous Pinot Blanc, this combines aromatic hints of almond with mixed citrus fruit and rind, zippy acidity and a great wash of minerality. It cleanses and tickles the palate, lingering sensuously through a finish of surprising depth.",92,29.0
11,Testarossa,"There's an expert balance between lightly melted butter, pithy Meyer lemon and toasted marcona almond on the nose of this bottling from the region's iconic vineyard. The palate is wound up tightly, offering good grip and lots of textural length while showing flavors of chamomile, saffron, sea salt and more Meyer lemon rinds.",91,49.0
12,Iron Horse,"This is the producer's highest and most westerly vineyard site. It holds back from the start, still tightly wound and somewhat reduced on the nose. As it opens, ethereal layers of wild strawberry, green tea and lacings of herb and white pepper unveil to tremendous effect.",93,85.0
13,Foxen,"Yields tend to be low in this dry-farmed vineyard, which especially struggles during a drought, but the quality is fantastic. Aromas of browned toast, popcorn, Meyer-lemon pith, honey pollen and a mineral herbal chamomile character show on the nose. A vibrant chalkiness reveals itself on the sip, with lemon blossom and grapefruit pith keeping the palate tight, grippy and texturally zippy.",92,37.0
14,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"This wine is aromatically reserved with notes of milk chocolate, char, berry, barrel spices and high-toned herbs. It's silky and polished in feel, with richness and elegance to the coffee flavors.",90,30.0
15,Wines & Winemakers,"This raspberry-flavored wine is soft and ripe. While it is fruity, it also has a nutty character that gives it a rich taste. It's dry and in a style that will make it better with food than by itself.",85,12.0
16,Iron Horse,"A beautiful sparkling wine that shows the Iron Horse signature of balanced elegance. The lime, raspberry, vanilla and brioche flavors are rich and intricate, but particularly lovely is the texture, which is soft and silky.",92,40.0
17,Georges Duboeuf,"Attractive cherry flavors give a ripe, rounded feel that's balanced by the acidity and tannins. Black cherries burst easily from the glass, delivering a full aftertaste.",86,12.0
18,Maryhill,"Aged for 20 months in 40% new French oak, this remains a tough nut to crack. It's encased in a hard tannic shell, with little ripe fruit, and is strongly flavored with barrel notes of tobacco and vanilla. Decant it or put it through an aerator.",86,25.0
19,Fess Parker,"Tar and beef char kick off the nose on this dark and heavy wine, which offers asphalt, smoked meats and crushed elderberry. Caramelized beef, balsamic-blackberry reduction, tobacco and touches of smoke show on the palate.",90,28.0
20,Chehalem,"This is surprisingly light, having dropped significantly in alcohol from the previous vintage. Green-fruit flavors touch on banana and apple, and the wood—31% new and 26% once-used—seems to show a bit of rawness. Give this another couple of years of bottle age before opening.",87,40.0
21,Chehalem,"This is a pleasant white wine, albeit rather generic, as Pinot Blanc is prone to be. Crisp apple flavors and a touch of grapefruit are the focus. Drink chilled and enjoy it while it's still young and fresh.",87,29.0
22,Santa Ema,"Light and tropical, with buttercup aromas and a touch of citrus. The palate is plump and slightly oily, but with good acidity. Apple, mango and banana flavors are fruity and sweet, but overall the wine holds it together. Drink right away.",85,10.0
23,Kendall-Jackson,"Clean and crisp, with rich flavors of citrus, pear, green apple, vanilla and honey. Finishes with that well-known K-J sweetness. A blend based on Sauvignon Blanc.",85,17.0
24,Williams Selyem,"Smoky, with bursts of sage and celery root, this is a wine that is unabashedly earthy, spicy, bold and juicy at its core. Light-bodied and delicate, the palate shows beautiful floral undertones. This is a complex and beguiling bottling that should hold well for years to come.",94,58.0
25,Robert Mondavi,"The winery shows its prowess with making delicious, affordable larger-production wines with this bright and easy drinking Cabernet, a study in soft tannins, juicy cranberry/currant fruit and composed structure. It's a good one to stock up on at the price and quality.",90,28.0
26,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Coming from the warm 2013 vintage, this is an aromatic offering, with notes of pineapple, kiwi, herbs and oak spices (40% barrel fermented). It's creamy in feel, but with tart, vibrant acidity that keeps the palate fresh and lively.",90,15.0
27,Concha y Toro,"Prickly aromas of nettle are simple as well as diluted. This feels basic and fresh, while green, citrusy flavors end with pithy notes and an oily feel.",84,11.0
28,Concha y Toro,"Blocky, stewy, raisiny aromas of nonspecific black fruits are jumbled and green. This feels awkward and jammy, with little to no structural integrity. Flavors of prune, raisin and oak finish soft and loamy.",83,11.0
29,Trapiche,"Apricot and oak aromas make for a smoky, slightly heavy bouquet. The wine keeps that weightiness as it passes from nectarine to citrus to tropical fruits. Long on the finish, with integrity. But it's also a bit citric in the center. “Pulpy” is another descriptor.",86,17.0
30,Wines & Winemakers,"Made from old vines, this rich rosé is full of fruit. It has fine acidity as well as wild-strawberry flavors. The texture, lightly mineral, gives the wine a crisp, tight shape. With a fresh aftertaste, the wine will be just right for food.",88,14.0
31,Fess Parker,"Lilacs and wisteria combine for a floral and approachable nose in this clonal study, which is also loaded with clove, peppercorn, rosemary and elderberry aromas. It's soft and lush on the palate, with rich plum and black cherry flavors leveled by notes of anise, potpourri, fresh mint and Earl Grey tea.",93,58.0
32,Iron Horse,"After three years en tirage, this well-evolved wine is heady and floral, made to highlight and celebrate diversity. Creamy and lush on the palate, it has a rounded richness of stone fruit. Made predominantly from Pinot Noir, it has an accentuated taste of strawberry shortcake.",93,65.0
33,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Here is a solid, widely distributed, well-priced, all-purpose Chardonnay. It's got plenty of buttery toast, soft and round fruit—lightly peachy—and unusual richness for a wine in this price range. It's a California style with a Washington twist—real acid.",88,13.0
34,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Enticing aromas of honeysuckle, citrus blossom and stone fruit take shape in the glass. The palate offers juicy pineapple, green apple, white peach, mint and mineral alongside bright acidity.",89,20.0
35,Louis Jadot,"This dense and structured wine comes from a small walled vineyard within the larger Les Vignes Franches premier cru, partially owned by Louis Jadot. Robust tannins frame its rich, juicy black fruit, showing potential for long aging. Drink from 2024.",94,90.0
36,Louis Jadot,"This wine comes from a vineyard owned by the Gagey situated in the northern part of Nuits-Saint-Georges, close to Vosne-Romanée. It has firm structure and a perfumed character that is already enticing. Richly fruity with juicy acidity, it will be impressive as it ages. Drink from 2023.",93,132.0
37,Bründlmayer,"Made using fruit from one of the top Kamptal vineyards, this perfumed wine has great texture, with tight acidity and notes of green plum skin and lemon zest. With its depth of flavor and nervy, minerally edge, it will age for at least four years.",92,
38,Concha y Toro,"The nose is an attractive mix of cassis and mineral notes. The palate is more racy and wiry than dense and soft, with juicy, flashy flavors of berry, cherry and currant. Those notes all carry through to the long finish; drink from 2013–2018.",92,38.0
39,DFJ Vinhos,"This is a crisp, clean and refreshing wine. There is just the lightest sense of tannin giving the wine a zingy edge. Other than that, it is red-berry fruits all the way. Drink now.",85,9.0
40,DFJ Vinhos,"This is a delicious and ripe-fruited wine. Dominated by Fernão Pires, it has an apple-puree texture: smooth and creamy. The wine has an edge of light acidity at the end to give it a lift. Drink now.",85,10.0
41,Wines & Winemakers,"The blend of Fernão Pires and Arinto is a classic for the region. It gives a light and perfumed wine with a creamy texture and plenty of balancing acidity. Bright and fruity, the wine has just a final tang to add crispness. Drink now.",85,12.0
42,Williams Selyem,"A stupendous Pinot Noir, showing how beautifully this vineyard performs in the remote Sonoma Coast above Fort Ross. Williams Selyem's last few vintages of Precious Mountain have been extraordinary, but this 2009 tops them all. The wine is as light as a feather in the mouth, modest in alcohol and delicately feminine, like pure satin. However, few Pinot Noirs in the world achieve this level of concentration. Wild raspberries and cherries, cola, sleek minerals, dusty baking spices and smoky oak combine for flavors that are utterly delicious. After all that, it possesses an indefinable attribute of fascination. Will age well for a long time, if you can keep your hands off it. Now–2021.",99,94.0
43,Williams Selyem,"A drop-dead gorgeous Pinot Noir that will satisfy everyone from Burgundy fans to diehard Cabernet cultists. Show an elegant complexity and silky texture that define great California Pinot Noir, yet with a powerful impact that emphasizes raspberries, cherries and blueberries. Brilliant acidity and tannins provide the perfect framework on this wine that's drinkable now, and will develop over the next 15–20 years.",97,82.0
44,Williams Selyem,"A triumph, one of the greatest Riverblock bottings in years. This always is a captivating wine, but the '09 is particularly scrumptious. Although it's quite tannic and acidic, it's forward enough in raspberries, cherries and cola to enjoy now. But it's bone dry and as elegant as California Pinot Noir gets. The balance suggests an ability to age for a good 10 years, if not longer.",96,78.0
45,Williams Selyem,"A sip is all it takes to fall in love with this potent Pinot Noir. Big tannins and crisp acidity make it hard to appreciate now, but there's a gigantic core of cherries and raspberries, with a firm minerality from the soil. Will develop bottle complexity over the years. Don't even think of popping the cork before 2015.",95,56.0
46,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"This wine is equal parts Syrah and Merlot (43% each), with the balance a smattering of other varieties. The coffee and berry aromas seem faint while the palate delivers all of the plush fruit flavors this vintage has to offer.",88,18.0
47,Wines & Winemakers,"A light, crisp blend of Merlot and Syrah, this is soft and gently fruity. Raspberry and red-currant flavors shine easily through this simple wine.",85,12.0
48,Wines & Winemakers,"Structured and with solid tannins, this is a wood- and spice-laden wine. Its fruit lies somewhere behind all this structure and is likely to remain there.",85,15.0
49,Trapiche,"Reedy green-leaning aromas of plum and raspberry feed into a creamy palate. This tastes primarily of herbal red-berry fruits that finish oaky, dry and spicy.",85,10.0
50,V. Sattui,"This juicy red wine offers thick layers of black pepper and blueberry around sturdy oak. However, its opulent beginnings start to thin on the midpalate, veering into sour flavors and a touch of heat.",84,37.0
51,Georges Duboeuf,"Structured and firm, this wine has more in the way of dry tannins than of fruit. It presents a fine skeleton without much flesh, leaving a wine that is tight and extracted. It needs plenty of time, so drink from late 2016.",85,20.0
52,Georges Duboeuf,"This structured wine has a tight, tannic, dry character. It is slow to develop, leaving the black cherry fruits still masked by the forward dryness. Drink from 2016.",85,22.0
53,Williams Selyem,"This hugely ripe Chardonnay is just a little too big for absolute balance. Any more powerful, and it would be over the line. As it is, it flirts with it, with gobs of jammy apricots, yellow pears, citrine and Meyer lemondrop, as well as barrel influences ranging from creamy lees to buttered toast, roasted hazelnuts and smoky honey. The alcohol is over 15%.",89,46.0
54,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Feudi di San Gregorio's distinctive take on the indigenous Greco variety favors a more saturated and concentrated style. The color  is slightly more golden and intense and the aromas reveal ripe melon, honey, dried hay and almond.",89,22.0
55,Robert Mondavi,"Mondavi's done it again, produced another very nice Cabernet at an everyday price. It shows classy elegance, with blackberry, currant and mocha notes.",87,11.0
56,Wines & Winemakers,"Made from Castelão, the local grape of the Setúbal region, this wine is as bright and clean as possible. The light texture makes it ideal for summer drinking.",84,11.0
57,Louis Jadot,"With touches of vanilla and caramel as well as ripe yellow fruits, this is a warm, generous Chardonnay. It has freshness from the citrus edge and a soft texture. Straightforward, it is an open and ready-to-drink wine.",87,15.0
58,Concha y Toro,"We won't call this the best Terrunyo SB to date, but it is typically clean, mineral and full of lime and passion fruit. The overall balance and purity are up the ladder, while the flavors of green fruits, passion fruit, brine and lime don't hold back. Top notch SB from Chile to drink now.",90,25.0
59,Trapiche,"Grassy stalky berry aromas lean towards green. This feels grippy, while spicy herbal berry flavors stay the course and finish with minty green notes on top of basic plum and berry.",84,10.0
60,Columbia Crest,"The toast, freshly ground coffee, dark chocolate and cherry aromas pop. Plum and chocolate flavors are smooth in feel and linger on the finish.",88,12.0
61,Louis Jadot,"At this stage, the wine is all dark structure and very firm. It will need time to develop its full potential as an intensely rich wine. Concentrated and firm, it is powered by tannins as well as sweet red fruits. So age for five years at least.",94,85.0
62,Wines & Winemakers,"Crisp. dry and fruity, this wine has a light touch of citrus and fresh acidity. Fruity with a slight sparkle, it's an ideal apéritif.",85,11.0
63,Montes,"Jammy black-fruit aromas are woody, reduced and come across cheesy. A thick, tannic, oaky body is home to flavors of plastic, creamy oak, vanilla and charred berries. This is pasty, oaky and creamy on the finish.",85,13.0
64,Kendall-Jackson,"Fresh in zingy, ripe blackberry flavor, this well-made Zin has firm tannins and a dollop of peppery spice on the finish.",88,17.0
65,Casa Santos Lima,"Smooth red-berry fruits give this wine a glow of ripeness. The blend of Touriga Nacional, Syrah and Alicante Bouschet is dense and full of dark berries, with a touch of wood aging to smooth everything out. Drink now.",87,15.0
66,Chehalem,"Tart and dry, this has a broad flavor that does not express much varietal specificity, with some notes of caramel and butter. Not yet knit together, this could improve significantly with further bottle age.",85,28.0
67,Georges Duboeuf,"This has surprisingly structured fruits and firm tannins for a Nouveau, and it still maintains a juicy cherry flavor and ripe acidity. The finish has a tangy, textured character.",85,11.0
68,Chateau Ste. Michelle,The aromas of lime leaf and peach are bright and appealing. It drinks medium sweet with a finish that lingers.,88,9.0
69,Columbia Crest,"This Cabernet Franc (70%) and Merlot blend brings aromas of green herbs, dark chocolate, flowers and a mixture of red and black fruit. It's soft in feel with polished fruit and barrel flavors that linger.",88,12.0
70,Iron Horse,"Ripe, flashy fruit stars in this unoaked Chardonnay, in the form of pineapples, kiwis, limes and pears. The grapes for this delicious wine come from the winery's estate vineyard, in the cool southwestern pocket of the Russian River Valley.",90,27.0
71,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"With 12% Sémillon in the blend, this is a lovely, fresh, almost exuberant Sauvignon Blanc. Bracing and textural, with good varietal character but no excessive herbaceousness, it's loaded with fruit flavors of melon, grapefruit, kiwi and apple. A fine mix of precision and length.",90,11.0
72,Georges Duboeuf,"This is a concentrated, firm and tannic wine. It has a structured feel from Chiroubles, which are the highest vineyards in Beaujolais. With its black fruits, dark tannins and concentrated texture, it could certainly age for 2–3 years, although it is ready to drink now.",90,
73,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"This 95% Cabernet Sauvignon with the balance of Merlot, Syrah and Malbec, is immediately accessible with notes of char, roasted coffee bean and cherry. The palate is rich, chocolaty and seamlessly stitched together.",90,30.0
74,Undurraga,"Smooth smelling, with pure and fresh berry and plum aromas. Very young and a bit tangy on the palate, with cherry and berry flavors and an oaky, soft finish that goes sweet then sour, and lasts for a long time. In terms of structure, it's balanced, mildly tannic, yet meant for drinking now.",87,12.0
75,Iron Horse,"As easy and tasty as a summer wine gets, this blush also has a lovely coppery-pink color. Flavors of fresh strawberries and spice burst on the palate, and drink just a tad off-dry.",87,15.0
76,Montes,"Solid and sturdy, and more big than small, this Syrah runs toward the red-fruit spectrum. But the nose offers dried fruit, herbs and clove, while there's more clove and fennel underneath the fruit on the palate. There's oak throughout, especially on the finish, but it's not overdone. And if many Syrah-based wines need time to settle, this one seems made for immediate drinking.",87,20.0
77,Concha y Toro,"This Merlot excels beyond its bargain classification by showing purity and a high level of fruit quality. The bouquet exudes plum, chocolate and some creaminess, while the palate bursts with blackberry, bitter chocolate and espresso. Round and satisfying, with enough structure to last a year or two—or until the next vintage comes around.",87,7.0
78,Undurraga,"Dusty earth, seashell notes and tomato aromas don't fully announce how snappy, tart and racy this coastal PN is. Almost sour red-plum and pie-cherry flavors finish angular, sharp and zesty to an extreme.",86,17.0
79,Concha y Toro,"Aromas of herbal red fruits, tobacco and vanilla are basic and modest. This has a wiry, acidic mouthfeel and flavors of mixed herbs, tomato, pie cherry, red plum and olive. A fresh, racy finish is tangy and tomatoey.",86,11.0
80,Montes,"Forced, candied aromas of chocolaty oak and herbal, slightly weedy berry fruits feed into a chunky, blocky, creamy palate with saucy berry flavors combined with minty, top-heavy oak. The finish tastes minty, lactic and oaky, with heat.",84,13.0
81,Maryhill,"Pear and spice aromas lead to rich pineapple and prickly pear flavors. There's much to love, with unmistakable varietal expression.",87,14.0
82,Georges Duboeuf,"This is a romantic conjunction of names. The cru wine is silky and smooth, with integrated tannins and red-cherry fruit. It is bright and crisply textured, ready to drink from mid-2017.",88,22.0
83,Georges Duboeuf,"This cru wine comes from a 44-acre vineyard with 50-year-old vines supplied by one of Duboeuf's regular growers. It is structured and dense, perhaps too dense with its heavy dry tannins. The wine will need time. Drink from 2019.",88,20.0
84,Georges Duboeuf,"Full of crisp fruit, this cru wine is bright with red-berry flavors. It is light and with a cool character that comes from the high altitude of the vineyards. There is an edgy texture that keeps the wine together. Drink now.",88,20.0
85,Georges Duboeuf,"A floral wine, full of ripe black-cherry fruit and with a firm structure that sustains the wine. This cru wine is rich, still developing, still with enough tannins and acidity to allow it to age further. Drink this attractive wine from mid-2017.",88,20.0
86,V. Sattui,"The winery pulled out all the stops on this Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend, yet the wine is so tannic and sharp now. Shows massively extracted black currant and oak flavors that run deep and long in the finish. Who knows what this wine might do in 10–15 years, but it's a roll of the dice.",91,75.0
87,Wines & Winemakers,"Yellow fruits and apple juice combine in this fresh, mineral-driven wine. It's tangy, tight with acidity while allowing room for pineapple and tropical flavors at the end. It's ready to drink but will be better in 2016.",86,12.0
88,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"From the recent appellation at the southern end of the Côte de Beaune, this is a light and very fruity wine with little discernible tannin or structure. Red cherries and fresh acidity dominate and the wine should be drunk young.",86,
89,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"This is a simple, light take on Syrah, with a little bit of black pepper, a hint of underbrush, but none of the texture and detail of pricier Washington bottles. It's a light, pleasant red, fine for pizza night.",84,13.0
90,Trapiche,"Loamy berry aromas smell a bit like wet clay and earth. This is fairly well structured, with grippy tannins. Baked, savory, oaky berry flavors finish with wood spice, clove and light herbal notes.",88,15.0
91,Chanson Père et Fils,"Big, full-bodied wine, the great tannins dominating the underlying red fruit. It's firmly concentrated, intense, a powerhouse of dense texture and obviously a wine that will need aging. Give it 5–6 years.",94,190.0
92,Chanson Père et Fils,"Very dense wine, its tannins solid and concentrated. The structure is the leader here, with the young fruit showing through as black plum skins and crushed strawberries. This is a firmly tannic wine, needing aging.",94,205.0
93,Santa Ema,"Smoky, rubbery and sweet on the nose, with mocha and caramel shadings. The palate, however, is more tight and narrow; the feel is fresh and blazing, while the flavors are piercing and suggest red fruits like cranberry and cherry. Citric but with just enough weight to register as true Cabernet (with 18% Carmenère and 7% Cab Franc).",88,40.0
94,Bründlmayer,"No surprise that Willi Bründlmayer is one of the few in Austria to have real success with Pinot Noir. This is soft, ripe, enveloping, with bitter cherry flavors rounded at the edges with sweet tannins and refreshing acidity.",89,60.0
95,Georges Duboeuf,"This is one of several estates in this cru appellation where Georges Duboeuf makes and markets the wine. It is lightly wood aged to smooth out the ebullient fruits. Rich and with some firm tannins that will develop, it has concentration and a dense texture. Drink from 2018.",90,22.0
96,Georges Duboeuf,"This cru estate is owned by the Duboeuf family. The wine has some wood aging that adds to the rich texture while not detracting from the ripe juicy red-cherry fruit. With its tannins, the wine could age, so drink from late 2017.",90,20.0
97,Georges Duboeuf,"From the south-east facing Côte du Py, this is a powerfully structured wine. It is as full of tannins as of ripe red fruits. The wine with its dense character it likely to age well over several years. Drink from 2018.",90,20.0
98,Georges Duboeuf,"Owned by the Darroze family, the cru wine from this estate is produced by Georges Duboeuf. It is a dense wine with balancing rich black fruits. Its spicy cherry-fruit flavor and rich tannins give a wine that should age further. Drink from 2018.",90,22.0
99,Iron Horse,"First made during the Reagan-Gorbachev years, this blend of 74% Pinot Noir and 26% Chardonnay tastes of hazelnut torte and almond paste, offering richness interwoven with moderate acidity. On the lusherside of the sparkling spectrum, it offers a sweetness of peach, brown sugar and lemon meringue.",90,42.0
100,Lynmar,"This is one of Lynmar's most expensive Chardonnays, of their six 2011s. It's also one of the most forward and oakiest. Your first impression is of sweet buttered toast, sprinkled with brown sugar and drizzled with melted butterscotch. Then the tropical fruits kick in, brightened with citrusy acids. It's an impressive feat, but the wine feels overworked, and lacks the sustaining interest of Lynmar's other bottlings.",88,70.0
101,DFJ Vinhos,"An attractive salmon pink-colored wine, very fresh, with bright red currant acidity, fleshed out with some caramel, raspberry and a dash of red apple skins texture.",87,10.0
102,DFJ Vinhos,"An unexpected combination perhaps, but it works to give a fresh, flavorful wine, with soft tannins, juicy fruit and flavors of red cherries and vanilla. Not complex, and ready to drink now.",87,11.0
103,DFJ Vinhos,"Fresh green-apple aromas and some ripe, mango flavors, this is well rounded, showing some acidity, but more of open, fresh fruits. This is a wine that will be perfect to drink over the next few months.",87,
104,Chanson Père et Fils,"The green fruit flavors dominate this very fresh, crisp wine. It has acidity as much as fruitiness, giving a steely, tight character. Drink now.",84,
105,Robert Mondavi,"Aromatics of rose and mint give this wine prettiness on the nose before getting into darker, richer components on the palate. Medium in build, it retains a sizable tannin presence in its youth, complemented by dark cherry and a char on the oak.",88,60.0
106,Siduri,This California-made Oregon Pinot captures a sense of the particular terroir of Chehalem Mountains fruit. Wild strawberries are laced with peppery spice and a streak of cola. Good penetration and texture.,88,39.0
107,Santa Ema,"The spectrum of varietal aromas is here: saline, olive, forest floor, tea and red and black fruits. Weighty and round in the mouth, with good feel and full blackberry flavors supported by creamy oak and vanilla. Juicy and red enough on the finish, where a pop of acidity registers.",87,12.0
108,Chehalem,"Gamay is still fairly rare in Oregon but ripens well into a style more reminiscent of Zinfandel or Grenache than of Beaujolais. Robust and fruity, this has tart and spicy cranberry and cherry notes, with a nice acid/tannin balance that keeps the flavors moving along nicely through the finish.",89,25.0
109,Montes,"This rating is probably as much a reflection of tasting the wine too late in its evolution as anything else. At this mature state, the wine is heavy and syrupy, with stalky, almost bitter red-fruit flavors. Finishes with matchstick and grassy flavors. Wait for the 2011.",82,20.0
110,Santa Ema,"Opens with a mix of toast and dusty, herbal aromas, and with time it turns more saucy than precisely fruity. A bulky wine with a chunky mouthfeel and fleshy flavors of herbal plum. A late wave of tartness and more herbal flavors cements things into place.",84,10.0
111,Feudi di San Gregorio,"This is nicely balanced and easy in terms of its tannins and overall intensity, with enough structure to pair with game meat or succulent red meat. The bouquet is redolent of spice, black fruit and crushed granite.",88,19.0
112,Feudi di San Gregorio,"This producer has a magic touch with its white wines, and this fresh Greco di Tufo is no exception. Mineral nuances are enhanced by notes of stone fruit, honey and citrus. A dusty touch of talcum powder appears on the close.",88,20.0
113,Georges Duboeuf,"With a vineyard planted in the traditional Beaujolais style of individual bushes rather than trained on wires, this is a light, soft and fruity wine. It has attractive tannins and fresh red fruits. Drink now.",86,17.0
114,Kunde,"A simple Merlot, it's easy to drink, and will be very nice with everyday fare like burgers or tacos. It's dry and tannic, yet rich in cherries and red currants, with a smooth coating of toasty oak.",86,17.0
115,V. Sattui,"Well-made in an opulent, hearty style, this vineyard-designated Chardonnay is barrel-rich and full-bodied. Floral on the nose, and tasting of oak, crème brûlée and vanilla extract on the palate.",88,32.0
116,Testarossa,"This is the most remniscent of Chablis among Testarossa's new Chardonnays. It's a minerally, chalky wine, bone dry and with lots of acidity, which makes it racy and clean. But it also has a solid core of ripe oranges and limes. It's fine to drink now, and could even develop mushroomy bottle complexity over the next six years.",93,39.0
117,Testarossa,"Awesomely rich in black cherries, plums, licorice, mocha, cola and sweet oak flavors. Made from selected barrels of the winery's various vineyards around the state, its richness is balanced by brisk acidity and a soft scour of tannins. Drink over the next six years.",93,79.0
118,Wines & Winemakers,"This is a smooth, impressively rich wine powered by silky tannins and ripe black fruits. The palate is intensely concentrated with a big, bold structure and a solid feel. It does need some aging, so drink from 2016.",93,18.0
119,Gary Farrell,"Masses of cherries and raspberries in this single-vineyard wine, and also lots of acidity. It cuts across the palate like a squeeze of lime juice, tart and mouthwatering. Oak shows up in this equation as sweet buttered toast. Altogether, it's a complex, elegant, delicious wine that will develop bottle bouquet over the next 10 years.",93,55.0
120,Robert Mondavi,"Overtly sweet, with a white sugar edge to the citrus fruits, this is basically a dessert wine. Earns extra credit for cleanness and crisp acidity.",83,11.0
121,Wines & Winemakers,"A soft Vinho Verde, with white fruit flavors, only light acidity and some final sweetness. An attractive apéritif.",83,14.0
122,DFJ Vinhos,"Soft, sweet raspberry fruit-flavored wine. It has a line of acidity while its main character is the light, sweet aftertaste. Screwcap.",83,6.0
123,Georges Duboeuf,"Dominated by its dry tannins, this is a tight black currant and dark plum skin-flavored wine, surrounded by a firm core of tannins, a firm and dark-hued wine.",90,
124,Georges Duboeuf,"There is great structure here, with dusty tannins percolating through the rich wine. It has power, concentration and density, with cocoa and cherry flavors well integrated. Think about aging for 1–2 years.",90,
125,Trapiche,"Round, thick and pulsing, but not too hard, angular or tannic. The nose brings richness, smoke and black fruits, while the palate is juicy, focused and forward, with black-fruit flavor galore and a slight creamy character. Drying and toasty on the finish, with snappy acidity through the final drop.",90,17.0
126,Louis Latour,"A solid, dense wine, packed with tannins and with a dry core. The soft fruit has flavors of strawberry, hinting at richness to come. At this early stage, tannins and acidity are still forming. Hold for five years.",90,140.0
127,Louis Latour,"There is a voluptuous edge to this generous wine. It has rich flavors, some strawberry and plum juice. The final extreme freshness shows through the layer of firm tannins. For aging over 4–5 years.",90,95.0
128,Chanson Père et Fils,"Big, structured and solid, with powerful dense fruit, this is packed with plum juice flavors. The wine feels chunky, while the acidity keeps everything in proportion.",90,
129,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"The aromas are light with notes of herb, citrus and tropical fruit. The palate is a bit more generous, showing pleasing herb and tropical fruit notes accented by tart acidity.",88,15.0
130,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"The oak is at the fore of the aromas, with notes of vanilla, toast and spice along with cream. The flavors are full bodied with a lightly creamy feel.",88,36.0
131,Casa Santos Lima,"One of the top wines from this producer, this blend of at least 10 grape varieties comes from its estate. The wood aging has added sophistication to this already concentrated wine. With black fruits to the fore and firm tannins, it will age well. Drink from 2019.",92,26.0
132,Kunde,"Tightly tannic, this 100% varietal wine comes from the producer's family estate. It's big in blackberry fruit and oak, the tannins generous on the palate. Ripe, plush plums figure into the finish, the wine bound to appeal to fans of Zinfandel for its robust nature.",87,35.0
133,Concha y Toro,"Sawdust and campfire notes are the most prominent aromas on this oaky Carmenère. Soft tannins and racy acidity create an alert, snappy palate of plum and herbal berry flavors. A note of bitterness darkens the finish.",87,17.0
134,Concha y Toro,"Light but staunch cherry and cassis aromas are infused with herb and spice notes. This is tight in feel, with bracing tartaric acidity that results in surface-level flavors of red-berry fruits. Racy, mildly green notes are present on a snappy, hot finish.",87,17.0
135,Kunde,"This wine is lightly layered and linear, with stony green apple notes over a backdrop of toasted brioche.",87,17.0
136,Maryhill,"Hailing from Tudor Hills Vineyard, the aromas offer notes of padded butter, toast and spice. On the palate, the oak (70% new French) plays prominently, juxtaposed by full-bodied stone-fruit flavors that show some warmth.",88,29.0
137,Montes,"Sharp pointy aromas of citrus and green herbs are edgy. This feels minerally and citric, with no excess weight. Flavors of tangerine, lemon and passion fruit are pickled and briny, while this retains a salty slightly green character on the finish.",88,16.0
138,Maryhill,"Baking spice, vanilla, dill and cherry aromas lead to a mixture of barrel and fruit flavors, with the oak tannins bringing a sense of astringency.",85,17.0
139,Chehalem,"INOX—from the French inoxidable—is Chehalem's stainless steel-fermented Chardonnay, what some might label “naked” or “unwooded.” It is widely available and very appealing, with a tart, stony texture and bright, acid-driven fruit. Green apple and citrus are front and center in this vintage, with a steely spine of natural acid and virtually no residual sugar.",88,19.0
140,Chanson Père et Fils,"Initially soft, this wine then reveals a firmer structure, and a salty and mineral texture. There is an element of toastiness, rounding out the crisp apple and citrus fruit flavors. A cool, elegant wine.",91,60.0
141,Louis Latour,"A rounded wine, with a counterpoint of apple skin texture, the fruit flavors offering acidity as well as green plums. The texture is plush, velvet, delicious.",91,69.0
142,Louis Latour,"Big and broad with fruit that is full and ripe, packed with golden apple flavors. It has great texture and sweetness, with a well-judged touch of vanilla from the wood.",91,69.0

145,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"The wine is ripe and warm with generous red-berry fruits and touches of spice. The wine is rounded, full of fruitiness with a layer of tannins that is nicely judged to give support and breadth to the fruit. Drink from 2019.",88,31.0
146,Louis Latour,"Touches of wood, not new, give this wine spice and roundness. It is an attractive, citrus-flavored wine, with yellow fruits coming from behind as the wine opens up. Drink now.",88,28.0
147,Maryhill,"This 100% varietal wine shows raspberry jam, fruit leather and plum aromas that are bright on the nose. The palate packs tart fruit flavors supported by plump, ripe tannins. It's not your typical Cabernet but still provides appeal, though the alcohol dominates at times.",89,38.0
148,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"The aromas are exuberant, with appealing notes of apricot, pineapple, honey, white flowers and citrus. The citrus and tropical-fruit flavors are rich yet elegant, topped by a lengthy finish.",91,40.0
149,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"The aromas bring notes of toast, spice and dark fruit. The flavors are pitch black, showing the warmth of the vintage and appellation along with their appeal.",91,28.0
150,Lynmar,"Ripe, voluptuous blackberry and cherry overlie a dusty undercoat of tannin and minerality. These come across as rocky on the palate, complemented by moderate acidity and a rich texture. The fruit shows a maturity of both ripeness and attitude.",91,80.0
151,Williams Selyem,"The Heintz Vineyard is on the outskirts of the AVA, really pushing toward the coast, with the expected cool-climate characteristics of fresh acidity and complex, savory tones. This wine wows in every way, from its notes of exotic coconut meat and apple pie to its tang of Meyer lemon, all accented by bergamot and anise. The spice rides a wave of body and length toward the finish, alongside an unmistakable streak of minerality. Hold through 2024.",96,58.0
152,Williams Selyem,"Oh to have neighbors like these, bringing together several vineyard sites along this coveted stretch of the appellation. This bottling shows full-bodied richness and minerality dotted in a rose garden of pretty aromas and flavors. It's the silky-smooth texture that's most memorable, accented in earthy black tea and subtle oak tones.",96,69.0
153,Gary Farrell,"Tastes a little vegetal and simple, with cherry jam, asparagus and sweet oak flavors. Not a success, and a particular disappointment compared to the winery's other 2010 single-vineyard Pinots.",82,50.0
154,Casa Santos Lima,"This is a typically perfumed Gewürztraminer with the twist of a cool ocean climate. That coolness allows plenty of acidity to come into this dry, fruity wine and adds a floral character. With its crispness, it is bright as well as aromatic. Drink now.",85,
155,DFJ Vinhos,This softly perfumed wine has red-fruit flavors and plenty of acidity. It is jammy and juicy with succulent red berries. Drink now.,85,10.0
156,Trapiche,"Saturated in color as well as on the nose, this fruit-packed Malbec opens with grapy black-plum and cassis aromas. An intensely bold palate is loaded to the hilt with black cherry, blackberry and integrated oak and spice flavors. A lush, steady finish unfolds in due time and with no disparate parts; drink from 2019–2025.",94,55.0
157,Kunde,"From the highest (at 1,000 feet) of the Kunde's vineyards, it's lavishly oaked, with aromas of butterscotch, spice and custard; also nutty and creamy notes. Marked by intense tropical fruit aromas and oriental spices, it also tastes very rich. It's the best of a very good trio of limited-production Chardonnay wines.",90,20.0
158,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Harvested at a lip-smacking 42.5° brix, this seductive wine explodes on the palate with bright grapefruit and citrus flavors, highlighted with sharp acids and finishing with lingering notes of caramel and butter. Long and delicious.",90,23.0
159,Kunde,"A tremendously rich, oaky Chard that will blast your socks off and then some. The fruit is really complex, ranging from green apples to savory ripe peaches on into tropical fruit, and there's a dusty sprinkling of cinnamon and ginger. For sur-lie freaks, there's lots of creamy, yeasty, nutty notes contributing to this delicious, hard-hitting wine.",90,30.0
160,Robert Mondavi,"This wine needs food so much, it practically cries out loud for it. It's like the essence of lemons and grapefruits, in a bone-dry, crisply tart package that makes the taste buds sing. The oak has been kept in the background to emphasize the clean, racy flavors, although partial sur-lie aging adds creamy notes. Oysters and this wine would be a marriage made in heaven.",89,18.0
161,Robert Mondavi,"Shows the beautiful acidity and dry crispness that this bottling invariably displays. But this cool, unbalanced vintage has taken its toll, with a green unripeness to the citrus fruit that even the winemaker admits was significantly cooler than average.",85,40.0
162,Foxen,"A little tough and gritty, but with rich, forward flavors of berry and cherry jam, cocoa, clove and anise flavors. A Merlot-based Bordeaux blend.",85,30.0
163,Robert Mondavi,"This is a serviceable, soft and widely distributed wine, yeasty with aromas of baked bread circling concentrated red fruit and black tea. Light bodied and youthful, it holds on to oak and tannin on the finish.",87,26.0
164,Santa Ema,"Some may find this coastal SB to be too green and vegetal, but that's cool-climate Leyda in a nutshell. Aromas of bell pepper and asparagus bring on the pyrazines, while in the mouth, this is spritzy and chunky. A reprise of green, pyrazine-driven flavors finish fresh but slightly bitter.",87,14.0
165,Casa Santos Lima,"A mixed bag of varieties went into this soft and fruity wine. It has gentle tannins that are lifted by acidity and black currant fruitiness. With its lifestyle label (a small Vespa motor scooter), it is obviously meant to be an easy-going ready-to-drink wine. And it succeeds.",87,10.0
166,Kunde,"Made from vines well over 100 years old on the Kunde Estate, this wine is tight and youthful in dry, dusty and grippy tannin, with thick, extracted flavors of red berry and cherry. A streak of pencil lead and fig provides further intrigue and complexity around a full-bodied elegance.",87,50.0
167,Robert Mondavi,"Nice and dry, with some smooth tannins framing berry, cherry and oak flavors. Serve it at big parties, at the beach, wherever. Nobody will complain.",86,11.0
168,Fess Parker,Raspberry jam and oak are the flavors of this drink-me-now wine. Brisk acidity gives it a mouthwatering cleanness. The single-clone angle has resulted in a certain one-dimensionality.,86,55.0
169,Robert Mondavi,"Pinot Grigios like this helped make the variety one of America's most popular wines. While it's basically dry and crisp in acidity, it offers jammy green apple, lemon and lime Lifesaver candy and vanilla notes that appeal to consumers.",86,11.0
170,Concha y Toro,"Initially this smells foxy, with jumpy untamed berry and plum notes racing across the nose. After the aromas come around, this is hard and choppy on the palate, while herbal black-plum and carob flavors finish more lushly than before, but still fairly tannic. Drink through 2023.",92,120.0
171,Bründlmayer,"A curious mix of roasted smokiness and red fruits makes for an appetizing autumnal nose. The red fruit underneath these flavors is beautifully pure and speaks of raspberry and wild strawberries. The wonderfully refreshing tartness zips across the palate like a bright streak of light and gives freshness, direction and poise to everything. The flavors are lasting and long.",92,60.0
172,Fess Parker,"Black pepper is the star of this bone-dry, full-bodied young wine, in both the aroma and the flavor. Below that are bold notes of black currants, plums and leather. The tannins are hard, giving it a mouth-stinging astringency. Your best bet is to cellar it for 3–4 years, but it's somewhat risky.",87,45.0
173,Gary Farrell,"From a vineyard holding in the midst of prime Pinot Noir country, Maffei intrigues in ripe, hearty plum, black cherry and kir aromas and flavors. The tannins are soft and nicely managed, accented by notes of nutmeg and black pepper.",92,45.0
174,Gary Farrell,"Silky carpets of cherry grenadine invite one into this vineyard-designate, framed by seductive streaks of herbes de Provence and earthy black tea. Juicy and generous on the palate, the wine is also complex and restrained, its finish wrapped in toasty, subtle oak.",92,60.0
175,Maryhill,"Cherries and chocolate are the hallmark of the Zins at Maryhill. The fruit is pretty and the chocolate smooth, certainly a crowd-pleasing style. The finish is clean and supple.",87,30.0
176,V. Sattui,"Some unripe flavors suggest green mint and asparagus. They limit the score, despite some good blackberry tea, currant and white-pepper flavors. Drink up.",85,37.0
177,Wines & Winemakers,"This is an attractive wine, dominated by the typical Baga grape from Bairrada. Its tannins are tamed and rounded out producing rich black fruits and fine balanced acidity. The wine is ready to drink, although it will be even better from 2017.",88,12.0
178,Trapiche,"Smoke, rubber and spice aromas mix with ripe berry scents to form a solid and impressive bouquet. It's thick and saturated but balanced, with harmonious, easy to like flavors of blackberry and cassis. Long and solid on the finish; captures the essence of value-priced Malbec.",88,10.0
179,Gary Farrell,"Very ripe and spicy, with a sprinkle of dusty Christmas spices tanging up the wild cherry, raspberry, licorice and Dr. Pepper cola flavors. Zin doesn't get much richer, but this one could be a little firmer in structure. Drink now.",88,45.0
180,Fess Parker,"This fascinating Chardonnay combines elegance with the opulence you expect from California. It's ripe and forward in papaya, quince, mango, pear and pineapple fruits, but also shows a steely minerality that's as fresh and pure as snowmelt water in a pebbly stream. It is never forward or over-the-top.",93,35.0
181,Montes,"Blue-fruit aromas and flavors are indistinct on the nose. Massive tannins, lemony oak, plastic and graphite notes drive the palate. The finish is a forced marriage of licorice, oak, and vanilla.",82,13.0
182,Santa Ema,"Barnyard aromas with coffee grinds and lemony blackberry are less than inviting. This feels raw, scratchy and abrasive; flavors of herbal cherry and plum turn green and weedy on the finish.",82,10.0
183,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Campanaro is a unique blend of Fiano and Greco grapes that opens with a beautiful bouquet of stone fruit, honey, white almond and Golden Delicious apple. It a dry, crisp wine with a focused, fine feel in the mouth.",90,33.0
184,Gary Farrell,"A fantastic Sauvignon Blanc. Tastes as fresh and vibrant as a young wine can, with exuberant flavors of pineapples, green apples, cloves, vanilla and cinnamon that are wrapped into a rich, creamy texture. Crisp acidity makes the wine brilliantly clean. With the exception of the '04, an off-vintage, this bottling has been wonderfully consistent.",90,25.0
185,Louis Latour,"A wide-open, friendly wine, all delicious rich white fruits and tropical flavors. While it may not be ageworthy, it is a pleasure now, an opulent mouthful of Chardonnay.",90,
186,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Campania's celebrated Feudi di San Gregorio recently unveiled a new, revamped style for its white wines. This debut vintage delivers gorgeous tones of peachy cream and sophisticated mineral tones. It's an oak-fermented expression of Greco di Tufo from 15-year-old vines.",90,33.0
187,Georges Duboeuf,"From an small estate that also has vines in Chénas and Saint-Amour, this is a firmly tannic wine that also has attractive juicy red-berry fruits. The wine, still young, will repay aging allowing it to broaden out with rich fruit and a soft texture. Drink this cru from late 2017.",90,24.0
188,Robert Mondavi,"Toast with apricot jam comes first to mind in this nicely balanced white that begins in richness and evolves in the glass to offer a freshness of lime zest and grapefruit, the minerality well-defined.",90,55.0
189,Testarossa,"A bit of a letdown after a string of riper, more successful vintages. Feels sharp and somewhat herbal, with a hay or dried wheat edge to the black cherry and rhubarb fruit. Could just be going through a tough period, and might emerge on the other side in 5–6 years.",88,75.0
190,Kunde,"Shows the exotic fruitiness of Viognier, with a blast of tangerines, pineapples, Meyer lemons, limes and green apples, with flowery honeysuckle and jasmine notes. The wine shows subtle oak notes, but is mainly notable for its forward flavors, elegant dryness and crisply bright acidity.",88,15.0
191,Bründlmayer,"Notes of tart strawberry and wood sorrel rise delicately from the glass and scent the light, softly hued palate beautifully. There is interest here beyond mere fruit and the spicy core mingles beautifully with ripe lemon freshness. Drink soon but slowly to savor the spice.",90,25.0
192,Iron Horse,"From a replanted single vineyard, single clone site, the first vintage since that replanting in 2009, there's a youthful awkwardness still at play here, though the wine is quite juicy in black cherry and a lingering suggestion of soy. The oak and tannin are fairly firm and pronounced.",90,85.0
193,Louis Latour,"Three barrels were made of this structured, tannic wine that offers a juicy balance between acidity and dark tannins. It is perfumed with acidity that cuts through the red berry and dry concentration. It is a dense wine, full of fruit. Drink from 2019.",92,160.0
194,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"Flinty reduction still dominates the nose but this is only a sign of youth in this nuanced wine. It discloses tentative pear blossom and fruit, plus notions of wet earth and candied lime. Above all, a zesty spine of acidity and freshness directs all the attention to a profound, stony core. There is life force here and you know this will continue to evolve.",92,55.0
195,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"Flinty overtones of yeast reveal how very young this wine is. The verve that springs from the glass is undeniable. While the focus is on grapefruit and lemon zest in a tightly pulled focus, there are glimpses of honeycomb, popcorn, treacle, pollen and hints of tropicality, with a touch of pineapple. Hold this wine for a while longer and it will unfold itself graciously. Drink 2016–2020.",92,30.0
196,Testarossa,"Almost as good as some of the winery's best single-vineyard bottlings, this wine has a tremendous nose that offers tangerine blossom, pink grapefruit skin, sea salt and toast around a line of graphite. The palate presents juicy nectarine and ripe citrus alongside yeasty sizzle, salt and a chalk minerality.",92,35.0
197,Casa Santos Lima,"Light wood aging over six months has given this wine a polished character. Along with the rich black-plum fruits and acidity, it is a full-bodied wine—a very Portuguese blend of five varieties. The tannins keep the wine in shape and add to its ripe structure. Drink now.",88,15.0
198,Trapiche,"Shows little on the nose, while the palate is bland and flat, with simple apple and lemon flavors. Soft and chunky white wine with some drab tropicality.",82,10.0
199,Chanson Père et Fils,"Light and fruity, this is an attractive, rounded wine. With its bright acidity, touch of minerality and orange-peel flavor, it is open and ready to drink.",87,32.0
200,Iron Horse,"Luxuriously crafted to be lush and robust, this blends 76% Pinot Noir and 24% Chardonnay with ease and gusto. The palate is dominated by layered flavors of baked strawberry and cherry.",90,44.0
201,Iron Horse,"Light straw in color, with fine bubbles and pure, fine aromas of peach and strawberry. In the mouth, it’s exceptionally rich and creamy. It’s not quite as sweet as an extra dry Champagne, but it’s definitely heading in that direction.",89,26.0
202,V. Sattui,"A twinge of cedar and bell pepper show on the nose, before a taste of dusty tannin, clove spice and red currant layer themselves softly and simply around a medium-sized body. Let the wine open before enjoying.",87,39.0
203,V. Sattui,"The producer's proprietary red Bordeaux-inspired blend is austere in this vintage, offering herbal thyme and cedar along with a sharp element of pencil lead. Medium bodied, the texture is velvety and lingering on the palate.",87,80.0
204,Gary Farrell,"With the goal of adding subtle aromatics and structure, this wine was given eight months in 50% new French oak puncheons, with the other 50% in neutral. The wine intrigues as much as refreshes, with crisp acidity and bright sparks of citrus prominent. Medium bodied, it has a complexity of baked apple and pear lurking in the background.",92,60.0
205,V. Sattui,"Impenetrable upon entry, this tannic wine is leathery on the palate, offering notes of cedar, pencil shavings and tobacco. Big shouldered and full bodied, it's powerfully dense and concentrated.",85,37.0
206,Wines & Winemakers,"Light, fruity and off dry, this is a fresh and crisp wine. It has sweetened lemon juice flavors that are cut by intense, young acidity. Balanced and ready to drink now.",85,10.0
207,DFJ Vinhos,"Adding Syrah (Shiraz as the producer calls it) to the blend with Tinta Roriz and Touriga Nacional gives a strongly perfumed character to this firm, still structured wine. It also has a fresh element from the black currant acidity that cuts through the wine. Drink now.",85,10.0
208,DFJ Vinhos,"Produced from Touriga Nacional, this fresh wine keeps the acidity of the grape while losing any tough tannins. The result is an attractive, crisp wine, with final strawberry flavors.",85,10.0
209,DFJ Vinhos,"Spicy and light at heart, this is a perfumed wine that the winemaker reckons will go with Asian food. Apples, a touch of green herbs and peaches abound in this refreshing, drinkable wine. Drink now.",85,10.0
210,Wines & Winemakers,This is a bold and ripely fruity wine. Fine tannins and blackberry fruits are already well combined in a big and juicy whole. The wine does have a structure and layers of wood aging that suggest it will age. Drink from 2018.,90,18.0
211,Lynmar,"This wine could easily be mistaken for French Chablis. It's notable for the tight, nervous feeling that acidity and minerals combine to stimulate, and the finish is very dry. There is, fortunately, a great heart of sweet tropical fruit, like the purest golden mango purée, ripe and succulent and honeyed. Terrific now, but such is the balance that this could be one of those Chardonnays that changes in interesting ways over the next 5–6 years.",95,55.0
212,Gary Farrell,"Extraordinarily sweet and attractive in raspberry and cherry fruit, as concentrated and pure as anything in California. The acidity is beautiful, as you'd expect from this vineyard in such a cool vintage, and it showcases Pinot Noir's silkiness and beauty. Despite the immediate flash,  it will develop bottle complexity; hold until 2016.",94,55.0
213,Lynmar,"This is a best-of-barrels blend from different vineyard sites. It's a very good wine that grabs your attention with sheer Chardonnay dazzle. The tropical fruits are incredibly ripe and intense, with sweet, smoky oak adding supportive richness, brought into focus by crisp acidity. There's a core, like the nucleus of an atom, that holds everything together. Might even age for half a dozen years.",94,70.0
214,Lynmar,"The trick with getting a Chardonnay this honeyed is to keep it balanced and make it finish dry. Lynmar accomplishes these tasks with dexterity. Partly because of the acidity, partly the stony, crystalline minerality. The wine is terrifically rich in tropical fruits, melons, sweet Meyer lemons and ripe summer peaches, with all the buttered toast you could ever want from oak. In lesser hands, it would all be too much.",94,55.0
215,Gary Farrell,"Gary Farrell is one of the few wineries to obtain fruit from this coveted vineyard. As always, the wine is intensely concentrated in tropical fruits, green apples and pears, with such weight that it can easily handle lavish new French oak. The alcohol is refreshingly low and the acidity is brisk and mouthwatering. This gorgeous evocation of Russian River Chardonnay is flashy and delicious now, but the window of opportunity seems to be between 2014–2017 before the fruit starts to fade away.",94,45.0
216,Williams Selyem,"Insanely rich and opulent, brimming with apricot and tangerine jam, green-apple butter, pineapple tart, vanilla, honeysuckle, buttered toast and spice flavors. Somehow, the mass is reined in by a tight framework of acids, minerals and oak tannins. This shows the pedigree that comes from this famous vineyard, as well as the Williams Selyem signature of extreme class and deliciousness. Drink over the next five years.",94,55.0
217,DFJ Vinhos,"A smoky wine with black currant flavors that bring together spice and fruitiness. The wine has a light touch, licorice and stalky tannins ending with attractive juiciness. It is ready to drink.",84,8.0
218,Siduri,"Muted aromas rise from the glass to reveal wild strawberry and floral rose notes in this wine. Crisp, underlying acidity and strong, present tannins support its ripeness and concentration, the body medium and the oak well-integrated.",92,50.0
219,Albert Bichot,"The concentration of 2012 shows well in this dense wine. It is tightly structured, with a strong texture that brings out both the acidity and the zesty, tangy and nervy character of the white and citrus fruits. It's a wine for aging; drink from 2018.",93,
220,Albert Bichot,"A tight and closed wine from the southernmost premier cru, this is still developing. As it fills out, it will bring in the apple ripeness and fresh character that are just a hint at the moment. It will certainly remain structured and nervy with a strongly steely aftertaste. Drink from 2018.",93,
221,Louis Latour,"Big and fruity, this is very lively, balancing butteriness with green-fruit acidity. The wine is maturing quickly, its tension is fading into rich, wood-flavored fruitiness.",91,70.0
222,Louis Jadot,"This is a gentle wine that's textured with acidity, offering yellow and white fruits and some toast and spice flavors. It is round and soft, finishing with a tight edge of acidity.",83,
223,Georges Duboeuf,"This is very soft and lacking in definition, with a light texture. However, it does have a crisp apple flavor and a line of acidity that gives freshness.",83,12.0
224,Concha y Toro,"Wiry, scratchy blueberry and black-currant aromas come with an odd soapy perfume. This feels choppy, with outsized acidity and oak making their presence felt. Salty, briny plum flavors are cutting, while the finish feels raw and astringent.",85,25.0
225,Chanson Père et Fils,"This steely, mineral, structured wine speaks of the chalk soil of Puligny. It is firm and crisp, even though the fruit is rich. The wine layers the white fruits and mandarin orange zest with some judicious toast from the wood, leaving spice and ripe acidity on the finish.",93,115.0
226,Williams Selyem,"Although this Pinot is a bit thin, it does offer plenty of elegant sophistication. The structure shows off the Sonoma Coast, with vibrant acidity and a clean, dry mouthfeel. The flavors are of cherries with bitter skins, pomegranates, rhubarb, cola and peppery spices. Drink now.",87,42.0
227,Georges Duboeuf,"Soft and fruity, showing attractive ripe red cherry fruits along with hints of candy, light acidity and gentle tannins. It's a pleasing wine, easy and ready to drink, one of those Beaujolais that is best slightly chilled.",86,
228,Williams Selyem,"Pale in color and tart in acidity, this Pinot is a bit on the thin side, fruit-wise. It offers a blast of Asian spices and mint, with suggestions of cherries, citrus zest and Dr. Pepper. Drink this dry, elegant wine now.",86,31.0
229,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"A rich and fruity wine with dense cherry and strawberry fruits and a dry, tannic structure. It has a tough edge that suggests aging potential while also bringing out a ripe character from this southernmost appellation in the Côte d'Or.",88,46.0
230,Kendall-Jackson,"K-J's basic Cab has gotten pricier over the years, but quality has kept up. This wine still offers excellent value. It's elegant in construction, with tailored tannins and acids and fine flavors of blackberries and currants that lead to a spicy finish.",88,24.0
231,Foxen,"This dry-farmed vineyard reliably delivers memorable wines, including this Syrah, redolent with notes of oregano, thyme, charred beef and tar. The herbs, fruit and smoke integrate smoothly on the palate, with boysenberry fruit in the background and crushed bouquet garni on the front.",93,48.0
232,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"Beautifully balanced, this conveys both rich fruit and a tense, intense minerality. Combining the two strands impeccably, it brings out tangy apple and pink grapefruit flavors and a steely, tight acidity. It's a structured wine that needs to age. Drink from 2018.",93,65.0
233,Iron Horse,"This Brut-style wine feels extraordinarily refined in the mouth, with a silky, airy texture. The flavors of toffee, butterscotch, orange marmalade and vanilla bean are rich, but balanced with yeasty bitterness and bright acidity. Gorgeous to drink now, anywhere, anytime, with practically anything. Pricey, yes, but worth it for special occasions.",94,160.0
234,Trapiche,"Full berry aromas are fresh but come with a lot of oak and spice. In the mouth, this Syrah (with 3% Viognier) is chewy and a bit syrupy, with minty, spicy flavors derived from loud oak. On the finish, it dries out and turns warm-to-hot as it fades away. A joint-venture wine between Trapiche and Joey Tensley of California.",89,50.0
235,Wines & Winemakers,"Named after the barn owl (Tyto alba) that nests in the woods of the Lezirias estate, this has great tannins that give shape to the dense black fruits. With a powerful structure and so much of the Touriga Nacional perfumes, this is a wine for aging. Drink from 2018.",93,36.0
236,DFJ Vinhos,"This wine is packed with flavor from the ripe blend of Shiraz, Tinta Roriz and Touriga Nacional. Its berry fruits and balanced acidity give the wine an easy, juicy character. The gentle tannins are easily integrated with the fruit. Drink now.",86,10.0
237,Montes,"Broad, ripe berry aromas are dark and full on the nose. The palate is lively, with a shot of bracing acidity. Flavors of dark fruit, grilled meat, herb and salt finish briny, with a final wave of hard tannins. Drink through 2016.",89,25.0
238,Concha y Toro,"This opens with a blast of resiny oak, but airing calms things down, and ultimately the bouquet is round and full, with a mix of wood, vanilla and tropical fruit aromas. This is chalky, minerally and full in feel, accented by apple, pear, melon and spice flavors. Leftover oak and savory spice flavors dominate the finish.",89,23.0
239,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"Profound enough for serious contemplation but with enough broad fruit appeal to serve to a crowd. There's loads of upfront Asian spice and lychee, afloat on a luxurious, sensually textured palate. Notes of geranium and macadamia nuts keep the taste buds entertained and carry over to the lingering finish. The noticeable residual sugar suggests pairing with something slightly sweet, like Tilapia in a mango salsa. Drink now to 2011.",92,48.0
240,Kendall-Jackson,"Doesn't have quite the sheer ravishing power of the winery's Trace Ridge Cabernet, but this Cab-based Bordeaux blend is nuanced and possibly more complex and Bordeaux-like. The flavors are of currants, blackberries, cherries, anise and cedar, aged in 78% new French oak. Give it until 2011 to mellow.",92,75.0
241,Wines & Winemakers,"This wine shows the tropical fruit side of Sauvignon Blanc with pineapple and mango flavors. The acidity is there, floral and ripe. The wine is ready to drink now.",84,23.0
242,Wines & Winemakers,"With some earthy, rustic flavors the wine seems to have missed out on some of its fruit. It is more about structure and firm tannins with only hints of juicy fruit behind.",84,12.0
243,Maryhill,"This is light and seems a little sparkly, as if there is a hint of secondary fermentation going on. For Cab Franc it's light and generic, without the spice or substance of the grape.",82,20.0
244,Trapiche,"Aggressive and ultra-bubbly, with gassy apple, pear and pineapple aromas. The palate runs sharp, with green apple controlling the flavor profile. Sudsy and monotone on the finish, with a bland, green-ish aftertaste.",82,15.0
245,Undurraga,"Undurraga has never been know for sparkling wines, and this brut isn't going to help much. It smells okay, with applesauce and lemon-lime stirring intrigue. But the palate and feel are off. It's foamy in the mouth, with undefined white-fruit flavors. Not ready for prime time.",81,12.0
246,Chehalem,"A rare grape in Oregon, this is a bright garnet shade and scented with cranberry and raspberry fruit. Acidity brings significant snap to the flavors, so much so that for many tasters it will show best with some greasy/smoky grilled meats. A hint of Band-Aid comes up in the finish, but does not distract.",87,24.0
247,Siduri,"A 100% varietal Pinot, this wine has a faint bouquet of ripe black cherry and blackberry, exuding full flavor and body. Smooth, the oak is low impact, providing extra weight and sustenance while remaining balanced with the fruit.",87,22.0
248,V. Sattui,"This wine is a great example of why Riesling is so increasingly popular. Despite the “dry” title on the label, it's actually a bit off-dry and crisp in acidity, with clean, savory flavors of limes, kiwi fruits, honey and vanilla. So easy to like, and the alcohol is relatively low.",88,20.0
249,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Made with southern Italy's most noble white grape, this structured wine conveys subtle aromas of white and yellow spring flowers accented by whiffs of beeswax and slate. The juicy palate delivers white peach, cantaloupe, pink grapefruit and mineral alongside fresh acidity.",90,37.0
250,Chehalem,"Aged entirely in stainless steel tanks, this carries a light touch (7 g/L) of residual sugar but remains sharp, even edgy, with bright acidity and pine needle highlights. Ripe apple and pineapple flavors carry through the clean and refreshing finish.",90,20.0
251,DFJ Vinhos,"While Alicante Bouschet is probably more at home in the Alentejo, this wine from the coastal Lisboa region still has much of the dark color, solid, dry tannins and intensely juicy wild-berry fruits. It is ready to drink.",90,15.0
252,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"This wine is immediate in its appeal with aromas of lime leaf, flowers and peach. It drinks off dry with a zing of acidity that beautifully frames the full-fruit flavors.",89,9.0
253,Columbia Crest,"There's plenty of nuance and detail on this concrete-aged wine, with its baked apple and spice aromas and flavors. It shows a fine sense of elegance and balance.",89,24.0
254,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Canoe Ridge Vineyard is the warmer of the winery's two single-vineyard Chardonnay sites. Straw, spice and stone-fruit aromas lead to a full-bodied palate, loaded with ripe peach and tropical-fruit flavors. It provides lots of appeal, along with exquisite balance.",90,30.0
255,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Despite coming from the warmest vintage on record for the state, this wine displays a very pleasing sense of restraint. Aromas of straw, clarified butter and peach are followed by well-balanced, textured fruit flavors. An elegant styling only heightens the appeal.",90,30.0
256,Trapiche,"Dusty dark-fruit aromas are lusty and full of oaky notes including sawdust and chocolate. This value-priced winner is full, round, saturated and generous on the palate, where savory, resiny black-fruit flavors finish woody in flavor and firm in feel.",88,10.0
257,Kendall-Jackson,"This Merlot starts off tough and tannic, with rich flavors of blackberries, currants and toasty oak, girded with minerals and spices and finishing totally dry. It feels elegant and balanced, showing a fine sense of control. Drink over the next 5–6 years.",92,26.0
258,Kendall-Jackson,"A very rich Chardonnay that's creamy and smooth in the mouth. A touch of oak and lees gives weight and density to the lime and peach fruit, while brisk acidity contributes brightness. A great price for a wine of this distinction.",92,21.0
259,Lynmar,"This shows the chilly vintage in the bright acidity that makes this wine's finish so zesty clean. The flavors are tantalizing, suggesting golden apricots, limes and honey, but are complex in minerals and creamy in lees, making it an intellectual wine.",92,70.0
260,Lynmar,"The vintage was cool, lending this wine strong acidity that cuts through the mouth like a squirt of lime juice. Dry and austere, it offers oak-influenced sour-cherry candy and cola flavors. This should develop bottle complexity over the next 3–6 years.",92,55.0
261,Lynmar,"One of the best California rosés of the last several years. It's light bodied, crisply acidic, and ultrarefined, with flavors of polished rose, herbal tea, strawberry and spice. So clean and so pure, this is wonderfully dry on the finish.",92,25.0
262,Testarossa,"Plenty of smoky, spicy oak on this Chard, along with ripe, orange, pineapple and apricot flavors. It's a little rough around the edges, though. Drink now.",87,30.0
263,Gary Farrell,"Gary Farrell's Bordeaux blend is quite good and well-made, but it isn't showing much complexity now. It's a big, tannic wine that impresses with its blast of fruit. Blackberries, cherries, plums, currants, cocoa all swamp the palate, along with smoky oak notes. Maybe it will do interesting things in the cellar.",87,65.0
264,Albert Bichot,"Yellow fruit and toast aromas set the scene for this soft, rounded wine. The apricot flavors are right there, lightly lifted by acidity. A gentle wine, it's ready to drink now.",86,
265,Maryhill,"This 100% varietal Cabernet Sauvignon shows cocoa, green herb and cherry notes, with a hint of volatility. It's medium bodied on the palate, with scratchy tannins.",86,36.0
266,Maryhill,"This wine's smoke, seaweed, black pepper, orange peel and purple fruit aromas pop. The palate features easy-drinking fruit flavors, with gritty tannins to back them up.",86,16.0
267,Montes,"Big, chunky, rubbery and loud, but also poised and fruity. The palate is fierce and full, with some scratch but also very lush and ripe flavors of jammy blackberry. Fruity to the max, with a chocolaty finish. A massive wine for $12.",87,12.0
268,Wines & Winemakers,"From the far north of the Vinho Verde region, the rich and creamy wine balances acidity, green plum and crisp minerality. Aromatic, elegant, fresh.",90,17.0
269,Lynmar,"An extravagant Chardonnay, rich in buttered toast and vanilla cream from oak barrels, and opulent fruit flavors of ripe, sweet pineapples, golden mangoes and pears. The sur lie aging shows up in a creamy, yeasty richness. Holding this wine for a year or two will not harm it.",90,40.0
270,Testarossa,"Vanilla-soaked French toast and caramelized apples promise a butter bomb in this Testarossa take on the historic Sierra Madre Vineyard in the Santa Maria Valley. Once sipped, there is a surprising level of soda-like acidity, and a steadily emerging flavor profile that ranges from cream soda to squeezed lime.",90,45.0
271,Louis Latour,"In this powerful, full-bodied wine, soft fruit accompanies the firm tannins. The wine is already well integrated, showing dense red fruits as well as structure. A touch of wood will soften soon. Drink from 2016.",90,60.0
272,Iron Horse,"Juicy in smoked cherry and a thick, velvety texture, this luxuriously pretty wine blends several estate blocks and clones. Forest floor, cola, clove, pine and black cherry highlight an integrated approach. It stays balanced and complex through a lengthy finish that further accentuates the spice.",91,50.0
273,Columbia Crest,"This budget wine has sweet fruit and soft tannins, along with surprising concentration and length. Offsetting a hint of stemminess are generous, varietally true flavors, and a rich, meaty nose that suggests beef and coffee. Best Buy. —P.G.",87,11.0
274,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"A popular style, fruity and forward, with the emphasis on citrus, grapefruit and apricot, rather than floral qualities. Sweet fruit set against tangy acid makes it a versatile food wine too.",87,8.0
275,Columbia Crest,"A wonderfully fragrant nose mixes scents of fresh fruits and  blossoms, with a sweet and tart flavor profile. These are very user friendly flavors, ripe and round, with more fatness than most Washington Rieslings, especially at this price. Best Buy.",87,7.0
276,Gary Farrell,"It show the vintage's weakness, with a vegetal edge to the cherries and oak.",84,45.0
277,Albert Bichot,"A crisp wine, this is packed with acidity and fruitiness. It is tangy, tight, full of attractive acidity as well as lively citrus and white fruits. It is ready to drink.",90,16.0
278,Fess Parker,"Yellow skinned and Asian pears, jasmine flowers, lemon slices and a slight petrol note entertain the nose on this single-vineyard bottling from a part of the Parker family's estate that was planted in 1989. The palate is quite balanced between flavors of lemon-lime soda, tangerine juice and limestone minerality.",90,24.0
279,Williams Selyem,"Good, rich and spicy Zin from Williams Selyem winemaker Bob Cabral. It's not the most memorable Bacigalupi ever, with a somewhat soft, simple structure. But the raspberry, vanilla, toast and spice flavors are fine for drinking now.",87,50.0
280,Lynmar,"A little green and minty, with some stalky flavors, but dry and vibrant in acidity. Offers good cherry and raspberry pie flavors that are wrapped into a silky texture, with beautiful tannins. Drink now.",87,40.0
281,Wines & Winemakers,"This is a spicy wine that is full of juicy red-berry fruit notes. It is soft and gentle, with a core of dry tannins that gives the wine structure. Young and fruity, it is ready to drink, but will also age. Drink until 2018.",86,12.0
282,Wines & Winemakers,"Pear and tangerine notes give this wine an immediately fruity character. It has bright acidity, with a fresh and crisp palate. The fruit is right up front, with a soft aftertaste.",86,15.0
283,Santa Ema,"Herbal and earthy up front, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Carmenère and Malbec brings notes of green tobacco and black olive to the front along with toasty oak. The palate is tight and crisp, with choppy tannins. Flavors of toasty oak and berry fruit compote finish resiny, with juicy, zesty acidity. Drink through 2021.",91,85.0
284,Fess Parker,"Warm, slightly sweet aromas of smoked applewood and hickory waft from this rich and decadent Syrah sourced from the Fess Parker estate. On the dark fruit-laced palate are black currant and cherry cola flavors, bolstered by black licorice and followed by a long finish of vanilla cream.",91,49.0
285,Lynmar,"An impressive blend of different vineyard sites, given a touch less oak than many of the producer's single-vineyard selections, this wine doesn't skimp on flavor nor complexity. It weaves steely minerality into warmer layers of nutmeg, apple and preserved lemon.",93,35.0
286,Testarossa,"Crushed slate, plush rose petals, red cherry, smoked beef, vanilla and a slightly feral quality arise on the nose of this bottling from the region's most iconic vineyard. There is great tension on the sip, with tart plum skin, bright raspberry and dark cranberry fruit meeting with black spice, sandalwood and incense flavors. Acidity binds it all together.",93,75.0
287,Gary Farrell,"Vivacious on the nose, with hibiscus flowers, pomegranate, strawberry, rose petal and cola aromas, this bottling from a historic vineyard is both juicy and delicate at the same time. Vibrant flavors of cranberry, pomegranate, hibiscus and even red melon show on the palate, enhanced by dried fennel, sage and purple flowers.",93,65.0
288,DFJ Vinhos,"Apple flavors dominate this attractive blend of seven grapes, including three aromatic varieties, that give the wine its perfumed character. So although it is young and with enough acidity, it is the hints of lychee and peppered pear that add interest to the wine. Drink now.",87,10.0
289,Wines & Winemakers,"In praise in the Loureiro grape, this dry wine has lively acidity while also having a ripe full texture of apples and pink grapefruit. The wine is crisp and intensely fruity. Drink now and until early 2018.",87,12.0
290,Montes,"Opens with a sublime bouquet of tobacco, perfume and baked cherry that conveys a sense of elegance. The palate is saturated and full, with integrated tannins and flavors of molasses, licorice and prime black fruits. This is probably a denser, slightly more ripe version of “M” than in past years, evidenced by the licorice, sweetness and coffee on the chewy finish. Drink now and over the next couple of years.",92,95.0
291,Kendall-Jackson,"Monterey's cool-climate flavors of lemons and limes marry richer, more tropical Santa Barbara notes in this creamy smooth Chardonnay. Oak plays a prominent role, lending an edge of vanilla and buttered toast. This is a very good price for the quality.",91,21.0
292,Foxen,"Foxen's UU bottling is practically an insurance policy for great Chardonnay in any vintage. With 2012, the winery was granted a balanced, even harvest, with the resulting wine showing brisk acidity and subtle fruit and mineral flavors, touched with sweet oak. It defines a cool-climate style of Chardonnay in a most delicious way.",92,34.0
293,DFJ Vinhos,"DFJ Vinhos manages this 16th century property which has produced a now mature wine. It has great balance, the berry fruits moving to secondary flavors of spice, smokiness, sweet tannins and hints of toast. It's ready to drink, but will continue to develop through 2017.",92,18.0
294,Foxen,"With mouthwatering acidity, a stony minerality, modest alcohol and complex peach, green apple and tropical fruit flavors, this Chardonnay shows a Burgundian approach despite its California origins. Bone dry, it has a precise, chiseled elegance.",92,37.0
295,Concha y Toro,"Olive, spice and black-plum aromas come with some grit and savory accents. This is well packed and voluminous; flavors of olive, plum and wild berry finish sturdy and smooth, with minty accents. For a good introduction to the positives of Carmenère, try this.",89,18.0
296,Louis Latour,"Open and charming as its name suggests, the wine is ripe and soft. The acidity is somewhat lost in the sweet, almost tropical fruit.",88,75.0
297,Robert Mondavi,"This is a gentle, soft Pinot Noir, dry and silky, offering classic flavors of cherries, raspberries, spices and smoky oak, housed in a good structure of tannins. It's a lovely wine to drink now with steak or lamb.",88,26.0
298,Iron Horse,"After three years in tirage, this 78% Pinot Noir-22% Chardonnay sparkling blend reveals complex golden apple crisp and honeycomb notes. An homage to diversity, vanilla and peach purée tones add to the flavor of this richly rewarding, lively wine.",92,65.0
299,Casa Santos Lima,"This is an open, soft, ripe and fruity wine. With a finely integrated tannic structure and plenty of red fruits and acidity, it is a generous full wine that is ready to drink.",87,15.0
300,Columbia Crest,"Decisions on the viticulture and winemaking for this wine were all crowdsourced by the winery. Light aromas of herb and barrel spice lead to plush, easy-drinking blue-fruit flavors that linger on the finish.",87,30.0
301,Chanson Père et Fils,"This is a ripe, round and full-bodied wine. It has a touch of nutmeg as well as bright acidity and sliced-apple flavors. It is immediately attractive, richly packed with fruit and finishing with spice and toast.",92,148.0
302,Chanson Père et Fils,"Always an impressive vineyard, it has produced a dense wine in this vintage. It's full of both intense, perfumed red fruits and smoky, dusty tannins that give an elegant structure. Drink from 2020.",92,68.0
303,Kunde,"A wonderful wine, one of the best Petite Verdots in California, although the truth is there aren't all that many. It's sturdy in tannins and richly textured, with delicious blackberry flavors that are a little earthier and drier than Cabernet Sauvignon.",92,35.0
304,Trapiche,"Smooth and polished, this bears cola, earth, blackberry and floral aromas. It shows power and precision, with silky tannins, integrated acidity and deep flavors of berry, leather and herb. This is slightly minty, smoky and spicy on the back end, where fine oak takes charge. Drink now–2015.",92,46.0
305,Montes,"Earthy, warm and generously oaked, with berry aromas that bring leather and smoke. The palate is healthy and tight, with spiky tannins and herbal black fruit flavors. Grippy on the finish, with olive and spice. Very much a good-quality, typically styled Chilean Cabernet.",88,24.0
306,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"An intensely rich wine from vines planted on chalk soil. There is a spicy, smooth texture, with a bitter almond and cinnamon edge. The alcohol does leave a burning sensation, which detracts from the overall feel.",88,40.0
307,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"Certainly rich, but this wine is also about purity of spicy fruit, bringing out the fresher side of the variety as well as the intensity.",88,28.0
308,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"Light and only gently structured, this is a cru wine that is more about juicy red fruits. It has attractive acidity and a touch of spice. It is likely to be ready to drink in the next few months, certainly by mid-2017.",87,18.0
309,Georges Duboeuf,"This grand estate was once a hunting ground for an even grander nearby chateau. The cru wine that's now produced here is crisp and fruity, streaked through with acidity and red currants. It has a touch of tannin as well as minerality. Drink from late 2017.",87,20.0
310,Georges Duboeuf,"This is a family-owned estate whose wines is made by Georges Duboeuf. It is structured and firmly concentrated, more tannin than fruit. That gives the wine a lean character that seems to miss out on fleshy and fruit. Give it a little time and drink from late 2017.",87,20.0
311,Foxen,"Violets, bacon fat and caramel sauce are drizzled across blueberry and olallieberry fruits on the nose of this bottling from Billy Wathen and Dick Dore. The palate is expertly integrated and deep with flavors of blackberry, pepper dust, tart black-plum skins, cocoa powder and roasted pork. It conveys classic Syrah flavors, done with grace.",93,48.0
312,Foxen,"Dark boysenberry, dried lilac and the slightest touch of tar show on the nose of this bottling, one of the first that Foxen has labeled with the new Los Olivos District appellation. Tart plum skins and elderberry show on the sip that is structured by solidly dry tannins accented by flavors of lavender and thyme.",93,46.0
313,Iron Horse,"Meant to showcase the producer's classic style, this is made from 74% Pinot Noir and 26% Chardonnay, the lots chosen for their fruit forwardness. Succulent peach speaks quietly around bright floral aromas, while a richer undertone of hazelnut biscotti comes into play on the smooth palate.",93,42.0
314,Georges Duboeuf,"This wine, solid and dense, is full of firm tannins as well as red cherry fruits. It's also fruity, with a great juicy character that permeates right through the wine. For drinking now, but better kept for 2–3 years.",89,
315,Testarossa,"Savory aromas of bay leaf and fennel pair with mushrooms and freshly turned dirt on this single-vineyard wine. The flavors are also more earthy than fruity, with oregano, thyme, tea, espresso, cola and only a hint of cranberry. The tannins are strong, so this will last for a few years.",89,61.0
316,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"For the vintage, this is a surprisingly soft wine. It's already juicy, full of fresh strawberries and soft tannins. That makes for a delicious wine, rounded with a touch of wood. It's not likely to age much beyond 2017,  but is certainly attractive now.",89,148.0
317,Chanson Père et Fils,"A dark-hued wine, it's richly fruity with spice and wood flavors. It is ripe, full in the mouth, offering solid tannins as well as attractive acidity. It's suited for medium-term aging, so drink from 2016.",89,24.0
318,Robert Mondavi,"A wine marking the 50th anniversary of Robert Mondavi Winery's founding, this shows the grandeur of the man, the vineyard and the vintage. Full bodied and robust, it's intense in bark, tar and black licorice, with dottings of coconut. Aromatically inviting, it's dusty and soft, with acres of complexity and structure. Enjoy it in 2023 and beyond.",95,155.0
319,Robert Mondavi,"From the beautiful, historic site planted to some of the oldest vines of the variety in Northern California, this delicious white explodes in juicy green apple and an intensity of fresh-squeezed lemon. That succulence lingers atop a lengthy, salty texture wrapped in subtle, supportive oak.",95,40.0
320,Gary Farrell,"This is a stellar wine. Dusty citrus spiked with clove comes to mind first aromatically and continues through to the palate. Tart acidity supports sublime texture and a lightness that never means lean. Red currant, grapefruit and orange provide additional lift and focus.",95,75.0
321,Gary Farrell,"Bringing together multiple sites in one wine, this provides a fine example of the sum equalling more than the parts. Well balanced and crafted, it offers aromas of sandalwood and smoked meat that contrast with more exuberant, textured layers of black cherry and citrus peel.",95,45.0
322,Louis Latour,"Very mineral, textured wine, its acidity and taut green fruit flavors firmly in evidence. It has some of the richness and opulence of the vintage, with great swathes of ripe yellow fruits developing. For long-term aging.",93,299.0
323,Louis Latour,"Firmly structured wine, which also boasts delicious jammy fruit, very ripe, very opulent. The tannins are sweet and rich, suggesting aging potential over 7–8 years and more. An impressive wine.",93,359.0
324,Testarossa,"Silky, supple and easy to like, this great wine has complex flavors of cherries, currants, black raspberries, cola, anise and dark Chinese tea. Feels luscious in the mouth, but as light and gentle as it is, it's an enormously complex wine. Best now–2010.",92,56.0
325,Undurraga,"The aromatic opening includes a forest-like note, plus mineral and earthy berry scents. The palate feels chunky and wide, with solid tannins that don't bite or dominate. Flavors of herb, olive, spice, molasses and cassis are typical for the Alto Maipo, while the finish is defined by racy acids that should allow this wine to age nicely for another five-plus years.",89,25.0
326,Concha y Toro,"Electric purple in color, it conveys wiry aromas of wet dog, green herbs and berry fruits. The palate is loud and clacky, with a jumpy overall feel and an overriding sense of youth. Boysenberry, blueberry and blackberry flavors come with undertones of green herbs and licorice, while the finish is aggressive and moderately complex. Drink through 2019.",91,50.0
327,Georges Duboeuf,"This is a serious, tannic wine that has a mineral edge to go with the tight fruit. It is, in fact, ageworthy—for a year or two, with the dry character needs to soften. At the end, the sweet Gamay fruits triumph.",88,
328,Foxen,"Billy Wathen and Dick Dore pick this cofermented blend of 85% Syrah and 15% Viognier together on the same day. The result is very savory, with resinous herbs and root beer on the nose. Once sipped, a rainbow of dark flavors emerges: chopped Italian herbs, creosote, black olive, fennel, soy and orange pith, reminiscent of a North African tagine.",92,44.0
329,Santa Ema,"Aromas of lime and tropical fruits are clean and lean. This is lifted by citric acidity and spritz, while flavors of lime, green herbs and bell pepper are authentic. Beyond that, there's not much to this besides overriding freshness.",86,9.0
330,Lynmar,"This wine features inviting aromatics of fresh plum, coconut and strawberry. The palate entices with savory rhubarb, bay leaf, mint and cola. A tight core of structure partners with soft, plush tannins.",92,70.0
331,Siduri,"Adam Lee's take on this vineyard on the eastern border of the Sta. Rita Hills is rich with tomato, cinnamon, sour cherry and tart blackberry aromas. It's soft and velvety once sipped, with cranberry juice flavors and cola making for a fun yet approachable Pinot Noir, easy to drink but able to trigger deep thoughts as well.",92,49.0
332,Fess Parker,"Bright, fresh and vivacious, this bottling from the historic vineyard offers white flowers, sea salt, lemons and buttered white peaches on the nose. Apple flesh and lime rind sizzles into the citrus-driven palate, where a touch of lemon verbena adds complexity to this straightforward and delicious wine.",93,37.0
333,Kendall-Jackson,"Here's a supple, polished Merlot that shows lots of North Coast class. It's fully dry, with rich, smooth tannins and complex flavors of black currants, cedar and herbs. Good buy for under $20.",87,19.0
334,Chanson Père et Fils,"A chunky wine, packed with tannins that fill out the dark plum and black cherry fruits. It's solid, if on the dry side, with fine acidity.",87,60.0
335,Williams Selyem,"Perhaps the greatest way to taste this legendary winery in an affordable way, this appellation-blend bottling shows baked bramble pie, dried chaparral scrub, licorice, roasted beef and allspice on the palate. The plump blackberry and black-cherry fruit is leveled by rocky minerality and clove spice, all boosted by long lasting acidity.",92,39.0
336,Chanson Père et Fils,"While this wine has slightly rustic aromas, the flavor is lively, ripe and bright with good acidity and a thrust of steel that gives minerality. Tight and crisp, the wine will take a while to develop. Drink from 2018.",92,50.0
337,Iron Horse,"Exuberant in mousse, this wine is luxurious and rich, the perfect quaff for any occasion. Made from 75% Pinot Noir and 25% Chardonnay, and aged for three years, it's bright in bolts of green apple and strawberry.",94,44.0
338,Lynmar,"From older vines planted on the producer's estate Quail Hill Vineyard, this wine is thickly concentrated, with a generosity of oak. Creamy, intense and well made, it features complex layers of golden apple, butter and lemon bar.",94,70.0
339,Fess Parker,"Fresh and easy aromas of raspberry, plum candy, dark rose petals, boysenberry and allspice show on the nose of this clonal study. The palate blends big, joyous purple fruit and grippy tannic tension, also presenting lavender and Sichuan peppercorn tones.",93,58.0
340,Wines & Winemakers,"Blending Douro's native Viosinho and Verdelho grapes, this is ripe, wood aged and smooth. It has layers of citrus, grapefruit and white fruits, apple juice and pears. It is fruity, fresh and ready to drink.",86,18.0
341,Casa Santos Lima,"This lightly perfumed wine is crisp and clear. Apple and pear flavors are attractively packaged in fresh acidity and an orange-peel tang. The wine is still young, with its tight aftertaste, so wait until later in 2015 to drink.",85,10.0
342,Testarossa,"This is a reserve-style bottling based on barrel selections of the winery's extensive portfolio. It's extravagant in tangerine, mango, peach and oak flavors, with leesy notes of yeast, new oak and buttered toast. With brisk acidity, it's a rich wine that should be enjoyed now.",93,59.0
343,Testarossa,"One of Testarossa's best 2011 Pinot Noirs, of 14 released, this wine is, in a word, gorgeous. First off is the silky texture, as airy as a cloud. Then there are the flavors, complex and lush in raspberries, cherries, brown sugar, cinnamon and oak. The wine is so delightful to drink now, you might miss out on cellaring it until 2018 to see where it goes.",93,62.0
344,Foxen,"Surprisingly shy in aromas at first, this eventually releases pleasing elements of mace, nutmeg, star anise and red cherry. The palate is softly lush and earthy, with black rocks, heavy black plum, hoisin sauce, boysenberry and a cola character. With quite strong structure, this will smooth and grow more delicious with time. Drink 2018–2028.",91,64.0
345,Trapiche,"This vintage of Broquel reflects the cool, challenged characteristics of the '08 vintage. It has snap and berry aromas and flavors along with obvious oak, char and mocha. The palate is more driving and linear than previous years, with juicy, snappy cherry and wood at the base. Finishes with coffee, toast and controlled bitterness.",86,17.0
346,Trapiche,"Not all that expressive on the nose; about all you get is basic yellow fruit and lettuce. The palate shows more intensity, but the flavors of lemon and tropical fruits are basic at best. Chunky, sweet and common on the finish. Good for Argentina but still it leaves you asking for more.",86,15.0
347,Trapiche,"Tropical and toasty, with buttercup and banana on the nose. Good acidity keeps the palate zesty and moving forward, while the flavors of lemon, lime and pineapple are juicy and clean. Good in a fresh and simple way, with just a spot of oak character.",86,12.0
348,Bründlmayer,"The aroma is a perfume shop. Even on the palate, although the rich botrytis character is prevalent, there is a wonderful, exotic, Asian intensity of flavor. The acidity and honey are welcome and balanced.",92,99.0
349,Foxen,"From the winery's dry-farmed vineyard comes this bottling with seamlessly integrated aromas of boysenberry, black-pepper sauce and black sesame. A tarry character kicks off the palate and then evolves into roasted lamb with lavender-pepper crust, dried mint and tarragon flavors. A soft and deftly sewn acidity hums throughout the sip.",93,48.0
350,Gary Farrell,"A lightly colored, earthy and yet intense and powerful wine, this comes from a tremendous vineyard site along Westside Road. Pretty roses and cups of black tea are evoked on the entry before supple, well-built layers of lush, juicy cranberry, pomegranate and tangy cherry come into focus, finishing complex and rich.",93,60.0
351,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"The hot climate of the Cold Creek Vineyard sharpens up the contours of this Chardonnay, which shows more of a classic Washington character. Bright fruit, a mix of apples and peaches and pears, is shot through with streaks of butterscotch from fermentation in new French oak. It's been through 100% malolactic, yet retains some crispness. Polished and full-bodied.",89,20.0
352,Trapiche,"Broquel always offers a little more elegance and pedigree than most value Malbecs, and the 2005 has body, a silky feel and aromas and flavors of tobacco, baked blackberries and leather. It's a ripe, moderately tannic wine that's best for near-term drinking.",88,15.0
353,Undurraga,"Berry and cherry aromas are reserved. This wine feels plump, with slightly grating tannins. Roasted berry flavors show a hint of wood grain, while the finish is insignificant.",86,
354,Louis Latour,"Pure Pinot Noir from the south of Beaujolais, this is soft, fruity and with attractive acidity. Red fruits and a crisp acidity give this wine its bright character. Ready to drink now.",86,25.0
355,Trapiche,"Dark peppery earthy blackberry aromas announce a firm dry palate. For everyday Malbec, this delivers commendable black-plum, blackberry and dark-spice flavors. Pulling tannins make for a hard finish.",88,15.0
356,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"Smoke and the merest, tantalizing whiff of toffee apple can be discerned on the nose. Fragrant herbs—think chervil and yarrow—also make an appearance. The palate is dry but brims with ripe lemon oil and fresh lemon fruit. This is streamlined and impactful, with a commanding, overarching freshness that only enforces the inherent power of this site more. For now this is tightly wound and still closed, majoring on its ample lemon charm but this needs bottle age to let the myriad notes promised on the nose unfold on the palate. Drink 2022–2040.",96,100.0
357,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"Earth, smoke and lifted lemon peel create a very alluring, almost primal aroma. The palate comes in with gentle, subdued sweetness, boosting ripe pear notes before revealing fir honey bitterness and tangy grapefruit zest. A warm sandalwood-spiced core is still tightly closed, holding further stores of fruit and spice and signalling lasting power and barely tamed energy. While aromas are enticing now this deserves cellaring to come into its own. There is much drive and a dynamic citrus freshness wills you to sip more. This draws you in dangerously. The finish is dry and totally enticing. Drink 2020–2040.",96,120.0
358,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"A tender notion of slightly bitter, dark fir honey appears first before a touch of smoke and ripe peach come in. The off-dry palate uses its sweetness to underline the rich peachy fruit that also has a touch of golden mirabelle. The big bold palate is concentrated and energetic, pervaded by a streak of zesty lemon freshness that keeps this from becoming too rich. There is undeniable drive here, and a very lasting persistent length of peach and lemon flavors which will develop much more with bottle age. Drink. 2017–2037.",95,120.0
359,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"A flinty touch of promising reduction still hovers on the nose but cheeky floral and fruity hints of honeysuckle, jasmine and peach shimmer through. The palate unites all of these aromatic notions on a textured, layered and concentrated palate. The hints of honeysuckle spice are intensified by the ripe zestiness of Amalfi lemon and tangerine. The finish is dry and long, with ample refreshment from these gorgeous citrus notes. This is glorious now in its youthful exuberance but has the concentration, structure and fruit to age beautifully. Drink 2017–2035.",95,26.0
360,Lynmar,"From a meticulously farmed site, this robust wine is intense and powerful, with a baked fruit component that makes it compelling and delicious. Forest floor, sage and rhubarb jam notes enwrap its concentrated weight and texture, with an underlying acidity that tingles the tongue.",95,70.0
361,Lynmar,"This is a velvety smooth, superbly made white with delightful sparks of fresh-squeezed lemon, stone and salt. Ginger and lemongrass touches add an exotic quality, enhancing its bright freshness and core of acid-led tension.",95,70.0
362,Kunde,"Kunde has nailed this price point for Syrah. It's rich and complex enough to put on the table beside a fine meal, and while it's not quite in the league of a cult Syrah, on the other hand it won't demand all the attention. Dry and finely tannic, it features flavors of blackberries, cherries, leather, mocha, tobacco, pepper and sage, and finishes long and spicy.",90,22.0
363,Louis Jadot,A gentle wine with open and generous soft berry fruits showing through dusty tannins and lively acidity. This is likely to develop relatively fast into a delicious wine.,90,37.0
364,Montes,"Smells good and true, with dry spice and catchy red-fruit aromas. The palate is solid but not at all heavy, with lively red berry and exotic spice flavors. Lengthy and pure through the long finish, and overall this is the best Montes Pinot we've come across and also one of the best from Chile.",89,20.0
365,Robert Mondavi,"It's interesting and a little odd that this 100% Sauvignon Blanc, from Mondavi's heralded To Kalon's great I Block, already is showing signs of maturity, although it's only about three years old. The reserve To Kalon, released more than a year ago, was fresh and fruity. This wine by contrast is beginning to show mushroom, herb and mineral complexities alongside the citrus fruits. It's a very fine wine, superior in structural integrity and bone dry, but it will separate wine lovers into opposing camps.",91,75.0
366,Foxen,"Chenin Blanc is a difficult variety to get right in California, but few wineries do it better than Foxen. They have a solid track record, going back for years, of wrestling the wine's difficulties into elegant submission. With the 2012 vintage, Foxen has crafted one of their best ever. It's dry, moderate in alcohol and crisp in acidity, with complex peach, citrus, green apple, wax bean and herb flavors.",91,25.0
367,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Aged in a mixture of French oak (32% new) and stainless steel, it shows the best of both with fresh peach notes and barrel spices intermingling with crème fraîche. It's creamy in feel with the concentration winnowing slightly toward the finish.",89,22.0
368,Wines & Winemakers,"From old vines trained on high trellises, this fruity wine is bright with citrusy acidity and lemon zest-like texture. Its creamier side emerges as the wine develops in the glass. Best to wait until 2018.",88,23.0
369,Wines & Winemakers,"Still with its firm tannins in place and with layers of wood aging flavors, this is obviously a young wine. It has a background of ripe berry fruits and acidity that will develop over the next two years. It is potentially rich and full. Drink from 2017.",87,15.0
370,Wines & Winemakers,"The wine has a fat fruity texture along with acidity and plenty of tannins. It is austere in character, very dry and dense and with a serious intent. There is a juicy aftertaste that is more attractive and has promise for the future.",87,18.0
371,Wines & Winemakers,"A classic Douro blend of Touriga Nacional, Touriga Franca and Tinta Roriz makes a harmonious wine that has ripe berry fruits and a soft structure. It is a stylish wine with a fresh fruity aftertaste. Drink now.",87,12.0
372,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Co-fermented with Viognier (for the first time at Ste. Michelle), this aims for a brighter, softer style of Syrah. It's plenty soft, pleasantly accessible, and lightly toasty. The smoothness seems to have eliminated some of the brightness, the hills and valleys that make Syrah so distinctive in Washington.",87,13.0
373,Kendall-Jackson,"An exuberantly fruity, low-tannin Pinot with quite a bit of charm. Bursting with young, jammy wild-berry fruit, it tastes fruity and very spicy. Has those soft, juicy tannins that make it immediately drinkable, especially with spicy, salty foods.",87,17.0
374,Concha y Toro,"This is a ripe Syrah, with warm, earthy, raisiny aromas of blackberry, vanilla and prune. The palate is so dense and extracted that it feels spongy, while a full-force flavor profile includes inky blackberry, graphite and minty oak. On the finish, this is fat, jammy and baked in flavor while soft in feel. Drink through 2018.",91,200.0
375,Bründlmayer,"From the Vogelsang, or “bird song” vineyard, this wine sings melodiously. It has bright green and citrus fruits, lively acidity and a crisp, dancing feel. There is a youthful feel to the acidity that demands a year in bottle. Screwcap.",89,32.0
376,Undurraga,"A big, syrupy five-grape blend that delivers the full allotment of baked, ripe berry aromas followed by a firm, tannic palate housing serious flavors of blackberry, eucalyptus, olive and mineral. Very long and layered on the finish, with acidic zest to keep it pulsing. Drink now through 2015.",91,60.0
377,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"A marvelous effort in a difficult year, this textbook Washington Riesling is bursting with apricot and peach goodness. Round and polished, it's long and textured, with an excellent wash of minerality.",91,9.0
378,Georges Duboeuf,"This big, burly effort is structured and solidly textured. It has weight accompanying the blackberry flavor, with a firm character that demands aging over at least 18 months. The finish is still firm and concentrated.",91,
379,Georges Duboeuf,"A solid and chunky wine, this balances a rich structure with ripe, rounded fruit. Acidity cuts through the complex texture to give a juicy, fragrant feel. It's worth aging another year.",91,
380,Iron Horse,"This is one of Iron Horse's sweeter sparkling wines. There's a sugary edge to the raspberry, strawberry, lime and orange flavors. But it's not too sweet, and there's plenty of balancing acidity. The blend is 75% Pinot Noir and 25% Chardonnay.",88,38.0
381,DFJ Vinhos,"This is an off-dry wine, soft with strawberry flavors that are balanced by crisp acidity. It is light and fruity—a fine wine to drink as an apéritif.",84,18.0
382,Columbia Crest,"This popular Chardonnay gives you a generous burst of buttered nuts and toast, the flavors many consumers want in their Chardonnays. Not much going on in the fruit department—just clean, tart green apples, with a sharp, acidic edge.",87,15.0
383,Maryhill,"Herbal and earthy, this dry and tannic wine shows almost no hint of ripe fruit. It might be best with a burger or skirt steak to absorb the tannins.",84,17.0
384,Bründlmayer,"Smoke and flintstones play among green pear and savory yeast notes. The palate reveals a yeasty, cushioned texture, framed by grapefruit zestiness. The finish is clean-cut but persistent and is set to evolve over the years.",92,36.0
385,Chehalem,"Sourced from the Stoller vineyards, this gets a late release after aging in 38% new oak. It's soft and a bit flowery, the oak nicely integrated with flavors of spiced apple, pear and a hint of peach.",90,36.0
386,Chehalem,"Oregon Grüner is still a rarity, but deserves a place of honor in the pantheon of emerging white wine grapes grown in the Willamette Valley. Grapefruit and citrus—both flesh and rind—form the core of this tart, mineral-driven wine. Even better on the second day, it remained fresh and focused.",90,24.0
387,Georges Duboeuf,"This Fleurie in the small production Prestige range shows firm tannins and structured fruit. It has a dry character, the fruitiness still developing as it ages. Acidity, a dark core and black cherry fruits promise aging for 2–3 years.",91,
388,Fess Parker,"Aged in four-year-old barrels for 16 months, this bottling allows its elegant fruit to shine, showing concentrated black cherry, cola, rose petal and ginger aromas. A tight boysenberry note emerges on the palate, dusted with clove and lavender and cut by lively acidity. A thorough and complete wine.",93,58.0
389,Casa Santos Lima,"This is a ripe, impressively rich wine. With dense tannins, spice and layers of black fruits it is concentrated, wearing its high alcohol easily. It comes from one of the home estates of Casa Santos Lima in the heart of the Lisboa region. Drink this wine from 2018.",90,15.0
390,Chehalem,"This aromatic wine offers rich fruit and floral scents. It's tart and spicy on the palate, with bright red fruit. Although aged in 42% new and 33% one-year barrels, oak-derived flavors aren't evident. Still, it's a young wine pulling itself together.",90,50.0
391,Wines & Winemakers,"This is a dark and dense wine that has solid perfumed fruits. The tannins, still dry, are partnered with blackberry fruits, spice and just a touch of wood. The wine needs to age, so wait until 2016.",87,
392,Wines & Winemakers,"A fresh, fruity wine that also has some richness. With flavors of peach, canned pineapple, and a touch of greener herbaceousness, it's balanced and rounded. Wait until late 2014 before drinking.",86,12.0
393,Chanson Père et Fils,"A small, acre-sized parcel gives a wine that has both great structure and finesse. It retains the natural fruitiness of the vintage as well as a more defined texture. Concentration and densely ripe fruit are already finely integrated with the hints of wood. The wine speaks of long aging potential; don't drink before 2019.",95,300.0
394,Louis Latour,"This is the big one, one of the most treasured white wine vineyards in the world. And the wine is magnificent, balanced with restrained power and style. Yellow fruits are shot through with acidity that conveys a nervy texture and an intense, concentrated character. This needs many years; don't drink before 2020.",95,520.0
395,Chanson Père et Fils,"This is a powerful wine with complex structure, dense fruits and a solid texture. It's dry, firm, dark and still very young. The core of the wine is still tannin, the black cherry fruit giving so much richness before the fresh acidity cuts in. Drink from 2018.",94,175.0
396,Louis Latour,"One of the flagship wines of Louis Latour, this has great weight, richness and ripe yellow fruits, all surrounded by wood and citrus flavors. A sense of mineral in the texture adds complexity, while the firm structure needs to age. Drink from 2018.",94,140.0
397,DFJ Vinhos,"Coming from the cool climate of the Lisbon vineyards, this is a fresh and fruity wine. Some Touriga Nacional perfumes emerge from the soft tannins and final acidity. It's an attractive wine to drink now.",86,9.0
398,Concha y Toro,"This hard-drilling, bullish Malbec is bright purple in color, with grapy, heady aromas. The palate is rubbery and grabby, with a shock of zesty acidity. Oversized, roasted black-fruit flavors finish with size, power and a grating feel.",86,18.0
399,DFJ Vinhos,"In a reference to the storks who build nests in the chimneys of the Eiffel-designed DFJ winery, Storks Landing shows bright acidity, layers of citrus plus a touch of more exotic pineapple. A blend of Fernão Pires and Chardonnay, it's fresh and light in the mouth, mineral and crisp at the end.",86,8.0
400,Chehalem,"Steely and tight, this block selection reveals a chalky flavor of citric acid that overshadows the fruit, which turns thin in the finish. Ample aeration helps a bit.",87,50.0
401,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Instantly recognizable for the eye-catching purple dot on its label, this offers a slightly austere expression of Aglianico that would pair with almost any grilled meat dish. The soft mouthfeel is characterized by notes of cherry, tobacco and spice.",87,
402,Fess Parker,"Toasty aromas lead the nose of this bottling from the Parker family's own vineyard, with brioche, freshly peeled lemon and a slight walnut touch. The palate shows restraint, just barely allowing its crushed chalk, Asian pear, exotic white flower and chamomile flavors to shine through.",91,40.0
403,Undurraga,"Herbal blackberry, raspberry and leather aromas are solid and inviting on the nose. The palate is juicy and lithe, with a springy, bouncy mouthfeel and lightly herbal, earthy flavors of cassis and raspberry. Drink through 2019.",91,24.0
404,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"This bears apple and pear flavors that are set amidst buttery, toasty accents. It's smooth and easy to drink, and the mouthfeel has a certain oiliness.",87,13.0
405,Siduri,"A huge wine, massively extracted with raspberry and cherry jam fruit, with complex hints of mocha, cola, vanilla, buttered toast and wood spice. The richness is balanced by firm acidity, smooth tannins and a stony minerality. Seems to be offering its best now and over the next 3–4 years.",92,52.0
406,Siduri,"A fine wine that shows the complexity and volume of the Santa Lucia Highlands. The wine is thoroughly dry and fairly full-bodied for a Pinot Noir, offering rich black cherry, currant and mineral flavors. Its depth and sturdy tannins suggest cellaring for 5–6 years.",92,48.0
407,Georges Duboeuf,"Full-bodied wine that is soft, washing easily over the palate. The downside is that it lacks definition, the tannic structure lost in the velvet texture. Drink now.",86,
408,Louis Latour,"Structured and firm with fine red fruits and acidity, this is a wine that brings out all the structure of the appellation. It has acidity and red cherry and berry fruits that are shot through with a crisp texture. Drink from 2020.",91,79.0
409,Casa Santos Lima,"Named after the crickets, or cicadas, whose song fills the summer nights, this soft and lightly perfumed wine has citrus and apple fruit flavors, a tangy, flinty texture and plenty of acidity. Drink now.",85,8.0
410,Concha y Toro,"Pencil eraser, blueberry, olive and peppery notes are what you draw off the bouquet of this ripe yet basic Cab. In the mouth, this feels rubbery and tannic. Flavors of ultraripe black fruits taste sweet and come with licorice and espresso bitterness on the finish, which is mossy, heavy and choppy.",87,26.0
411,Robert Mondavi,"Here's an easy-drinking dessert wine, bright and crisp in acidity, with orange, lemon, lime, vanilla, honey and buttered toast flavors. Scores high on the Wow! factor that makes it so tasty.",87,20.0
412,Fess Parker,"Made from Syrah, Petite Sirah and Grenache, this robust, tannic blend has sweet-tasting jam and cola flavors, plus a note of peppery spice. It's a little hot due to the high alcohol, and it has a touch of green vegetable on the midpalate. Drink up.",84,35.0
413,Concha y Toro,"Warm, earthy, dusty aromas of red plum and smoky oak turn toastier the longer this sits. A fresh but balanced palate offers equal amounts of snappy acidity and creamy weight, while tart plum and spice flavors finish toasty and charred, with crisp acidity generating length.",88,26.0
414,Georges Duboeuf,"While there is some unfortunate banana flavor, the rest of this wine is attractive. It has juicy black berry flavors, an edge of citrus and final lively acidity.",84,
415,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Aromas of spiced plum, vanilla, French oak and blue flower lift from the glass. The firm palate offers the taste of espresso, coconut, star anise and wild cherry set against bracing close-grained tannins that give the finish grip.",90,25.0
416,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Mature plum, nutmeg, new leather and thyme aromas lead the nose. On the chewy palate, notes of licorice and clove accent a juicy core of ripe wild cherry while tightly knit polished tannins lend firm support.",90,23.0
417,Undurraga,"On first take, this small-batch blend of País and Cinsault is overtly oaky, with earthy berry and plum notes lurking in the background. A drawing tannic palate lets you know that País is in the house, while this tastes of oaky berry and plum. On the finish, this is more resiny and woody than toasty. Only 235 cases made. Drink through 2021.",90,30.0
418,Fess Parker,"There's a feral quality to this single-vineyard bottling, with dried rose petals, damp pine needles, dehydrated shiitake mushrooms and touches of violet, potpourri and dried ginger on the nose. The mouthfeel is velvety, with lilac and lavender decorating a base of cranberry and boysenberry fruit.",92,50.0
419,Gary Farrell,"Intensely dense and feral, this wine opens with a thicket of tart cherry and strawberry, followed by leathery black pepper and lavender. Medium in body and acidity, it works for the table, finding balance as it goes, before a rich taste of toffee finishes things off.",92,50.0
420,Maryhill,"A blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon, the Tavola Rosso is a wine that seems to be in search of a distinct identity. Tannic, drying and vanilla soaked, it has a red fruit flavor that vanishes all too quickly.",85,32.0
421,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Lacryma Christi is a rustic and savory red wine, with bright tones of dried currant, spice, tobacco and leather. It includes touches of cured meat and bresaola, and the finish is sour and fresh.",85,16.0
422,Wines & Winemakers,"The merest prickle on the tongue adds to the freshness of this crisp, clean, lightly sweet wine. Very fruity, it conveys apples and citrus, with a soft, fragrant aftertaste.",85,9.0
423,V. Sattui,"With 4% Petit Verdot added for body and color, this Cab is otherwise on the brighter side of red fruit and acidity, nicely balanced and approachable in cranberry, cassis and a wink of violet. It's not as meaty and robust as the winery's Morisoli, a tamer version of a similar beast.",90,48.0
424,Albert Bichot,"Soft and ripe, this has light tannins, red berry fruit and a round texture. It has a touch of firmness, acidity and good density. Drink now, or age it for 2–3 years.",86,
425,Albert Bichot,"This is full of citrus flavors, with toast and pineapple touches. It's attractive, crisp and ready to drink.",86,
426,Feudi di San Gregorio,"This barrel fermented and aged blend of Fiano and Greco opens with attractive floral aromas that recall Spanish broom and acacia with a whiff of beeswax. The austere palate offers green pear, citrus and mineral alongside fresh acidity.",88,34.0
427,Chateau Ste. Michelle,Light aromas of herbs and citrus lead to fleshy fruit flavors with a lightly spritzy feel. Pair it with baked chicken.,85,11.0

429,Columbia Crest,"A multigrape blend that seems to be lacking focus, this tastes strongly of vanilla and butter cookies, the fruit extremely light.",86,15.0
430,Columbia Crest,"Solid and varietally correct, this brings citrus and melon fruit flavors in modest proportion to a simple, but balanced midpalate. It carries a hint of sugar in the finish.",86,15.0
431,V. Sattui,"Almost dark enough, as well as fruity enough, to be a red wine, this tastes fresh and has a touch of candied character. The wine is medium bodied, resembles cherries and raspberries in flavor and carries enough acidity for good balance.",87,23.0
432,Kendall-Jackson,"Made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Zinfandel, this blend is stylishly dry and smoothly balanced. It offers upfront blackberry, cherry, cassis, chocolate and licorice flavors for drinking now.",86,17.0

435,Casa Santos Lima,"On the dry side, this is a fruity wine that goes towards raspberries and loganberries. It's fresh and crisp; drink now.",84,
436,DFJ Vinhos,"With a strongly juicy character and high acidity, this wine brings out the tannic character of the two grapes in the blend rather than the fruit. There's a spicy character and red fruit acidity at the end.",84,9.0
437,DFJ Vinhos,"An attractively fruity wine that's easy to drink and fresh. Lemon and apples give a crisp edge, followed by a zesty, fragrant character. Drink this light wine now.",84,8.0
438,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Vibrant and refreshing, this opens with aromas of tropical fruit, green apple and a whiff of white flower. The fruit flavors carry over to the linear palate, plus citrus notes and a vein of mineral. Zest acidity gives a clean, crisp finish.",88,17.0
439,Bründlmayer,"L&T stands for “leicht & trocken”—light and dry. This wine is true to its name. Yeast notes mingle with grapefruit zest on the still-closed nose. The palate refreshes with crisp green apple and freshly sqeezed lemon. An almost austere wine, it has backbone, verve and lasting freshness.",88,10.0
440,Casa Santos Lima,"A Santos Lima estate-grown blend of Shiraz and Touriga Nacional, this is a ripe, spicy wine that shows its wood aging strongly. Rich tannins and red fruits are melded with acidity and a juicy, fruity aftertaste. Drink now.",88,20.0
441,Robert Mondavi,"Cherry compote and a flair of kirsch preside over well-tended acidity in this full-bodied wine. Earthy lavender and herb give the wine an ethereal character atop solid, velvety texture and a big oak finish.",88,65.0
442,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Privilegio (made with a blend of white grapes from Campania, in southern Italy, that are dried on racks after the harvest) delivers musky and sophisticated aromas of bright fruit, natural rubber, apricot, almond paste and baked apple pie. It tastes sweet and syrupy but remains lively and bright to the end.",91,35.0
443,Testarossa,"A brilliant Chardonnay, brimming with powerfully ripe tropical fruit and pear flavors, enriched with smoky, sweet oak. The key here is acidity and the minerality that accompanies the best Santa Lucia Chards. Drink this flamboyant wine now for maximum vibrancy.",91,39.0
444,Fess Parker,"This is a beautiful Riesling. It's not totally dry, like the label says, because there's a vein of honey that enriches the orange, apricot and white flower flavors, and persists into the finish. The acidity is ample, and there's a minerality that suggests steel and stones.",91,24.0
445,Williams Selyem,"This is a lovely, full-bodied wine from a historic vineyard site on Westside Road. Bready and brambly, it offers a juicy, exuberant palate that's rich and layered in blackberry, coffee and a persistent backdrop of white pepper. It's structured and balanced, with a deft twist of dusty dried herb.",94,58.0
446,Williams Selyem,"This Guerneville-area estate is one of the last picked by the producer, and it delivers enviable depth and complexity. Highlights include a dollop of apricot jam beside rich honeycomb and toasty oak. Juicy acidity supports its creamy tendency toward tropical flavor, as streaks of citrus fiercely protect its freshness.",94,65.0
447,Bründlmayer,"Yeasty savoriness on the nose conjures up salty hints of miso and soy, alluringly so. The palate is even more salty and expressive, with waves of tingling white pepper. The fruit that lurks through is of green Conference pear and more greenish savor: think nettle and lovage, even watercress. A lemony fillip provides a fresh backbone. What a joy to drink. Lovely now but built to last. Drink 2017–2025.",94,70.0
448,Iron Horse,"X is for extra dry, and this is, made from 74% Pinot Noir, the remainder Chardonnay. It jumps out of the glass in an explosion of nutty, salty lemon peel, dry as a bone and rewarding in its full embrace of minerality. This sparkler begs for oysters and a skiff out to sea.",94,50.0
449,Santa Ema,"Can't-miss aromas of juniper, olive and tree bark dominate lesser notes of lemon peel and blackberry. This feels taut and rubbery, with tomatoey acidity. Woodsy, herbal, gritty flavors of currant and cranberry finish tart and with a note of minty green.",84,12.0
450,Kunde,"There's a funky herbal, slightly green quality to this wine, possessed of plenty acidity, as the variety is known for, yet muted in its typical floral aromatics and bright fruit.",84,30.0
451,Santa Ema,"Dusty white-fruit and vanilla aromas are leesy and sweet smelling. The palate on this unoaked Chardonnay is light, with modest acidity. Ripe honeydew melon and apple flavors finish soft and simple.",84,10.0
452,Trapiche,"Toasty but dull, with oily walnut aromas matched by stale fruit. This is heavy and baked out; sweet and flat as a board.",81,11.0
453,Louis Jadot,"Enveloping ripe fruit is tempered with a deliciously crisp mineral edge. The wood floats into the wine, a delicate layer, never too intrusive, while lemon zest gives an attractive aftertaste.",92,
454,Louis Jadot,"Taut, tense, structured and tight-knit, this wine is almost steely in its direct line of taste. The fruit has some richness and flavors of pears and some spice, but this wine relies on its impressive structure.",92,
455,Bründlmayer,"An intensely acidic wine, its tannins and spice acting as a foil to the freshest of black currant fruit flavors. It's definitely a cool-climate red. Screwcap.",86,
456,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Smooth and oaky, with a soft and accessible appeal, this is a more limited production offering than the Chateau's regular Columbia Valley Chardonnay. Though undeniably charming, it thins out quickly and does not have the vivid complexity of its sibling.",86,18.0
457,Georges Duboeuf,"This rich, full wine delivers great balance between acidity, fruit and structure. It's ripe, with delicious cherry fruits and soft tannins. It could well age through 2015, but is delicious now.",87,12.0
458,Undurraga,"On the nose, this everyday SB delivers pungency and citrusy green-fruit scents. The mouthfeel is racy, while flavors of lime, passion fruit and grapefruit finish zesty and with green, herbal notes of thyme and oregano.",87,13.0
459,Kunde,"Substantial in dense red plum and black cherry, this dry, chewy wine will benefit from a decant or time in the glass. It furnishes a high-toned kick of acidity on the finish.",86,22.0
460,Georges Duboeuf,"This Brouilly is light and smooth in character. The wine has hints of tannins under the bright cherry fruits, fresh acidity and open texture. It's not a wine for aging.",84,
461,Fess Parker,"This is off-dry to sweet, with honey, orange and vanilla flavors with a touch of petrol.",84,14.0
462,Fess Parker,"Even though there's no new oak on this wine, it tastes oaky. Shows strong buttered toast and butterscotch flavors, with underlying tropical fruits, pears, white flowers and minerals. Very rich and thick, it can be an interesting substitute for a big, buttery Chardonnay.",89,35.0
463,Santa Ema,"Full-volume cherry and cassis are in the lead on the nose. This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Carmenère is robust and ripe. Raspberry, red plum, strawberry and pie cherry flavors cover the full red-fruit spectrum, while the finish remains fruity and bright, with a ton of energy. Drink through 2022.",90,50.0
464,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Forward and spicy, this puts some muscle into the Merlot with earthy, tongue-gripping tannins. The fruit has a sweet tomato flavor, with a streak of cherry candy. Though not entirely knit together, it's a pleasant drink best enjoyed young.",86,18.0
465,DFJ Vinhos,"Almost black in color, this is a concentrated powerhouse of black plum, damsons and dark berry fruits. It is explosively rich and densely structured, with intense juicy fruit.",90,13.0
466,Wines & Winemakers,"Classic tannic Dão Touriga Nacional, packed with minerality, dark and dry tannins, firm and with a good juicy final character. Part of a range of wines from across the country under the name Azul Portugal.",90,10.0
467,Montes,"Minty, creamy and as oaky as can be. Coconut, sawdust, carob and other barrel-based aromas steal the nose, with secondary black fruit and thick tannins composing the palate. This is a ripped, high-alcohol, almost soupy Syrah that in some people's eye may seem overdone and too woody. But the fruit is of unquestionable high quality, and if you give it time to air out you'll get the best results.",90,82.0
468,Concha y Toro,"Crisp, leafy, peppery aromas accent core red-plum notes. In the mouth, raw acidity pushes the palate, which delivers dry, spicy cranberry and tomato flavors. Peppery spice and mild green-herb flavors carry the finish.",84,12.0
469,Robert Mondavi,"Soft and rich with pineapple, lemon candy and oak flavors, this simple Chardonnay has the benefit of acidity for balance. It's a nice, basic Chard at an everyday price.",84,11.0
470,Kendall-Jackson,"This substantive Pinot shows definite toasted oak character along with ripe fruit, full body and firm tannins. Hints of oak smoke and caramel waft over the ripe plum aromas. The flavors go to dark cherries and coffee, the texture is attractively astringent from tannins, and the finish carries a little bite. Well done but not overdone.",91,35.0
471,V. Sattui,"This is a very good dry Gewürztraminer that's laden in jasmine and honey, extremely perfumed on the nose, and light and crisp on the palate. With a suggestion of vanilla on the finish, it's a balanced white, ready to be enjoyed with a salad dressed with figs and goat cheese.",90,24.0
472,Testarossa,"Although priced considerably less than Testarossa's single-vineyard bottlings, this Chard is nearly as good. It's rich with tropical fruits, vanilla custard, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors, all brightened by crisp acidity.",90,23.0
473,Concha y Toro,"It has taken Concha y Toro a few years to get on the right path with Pinot Noir, but this cool-vintage wine is positive in nature. A dark color and toasty, charred aromas of spicy dark fruits set up a smooth, fairly deep and layered palate with cherry, plum and berry flavors. The finish, like the nose, is toasty, with cherry and spice flavors blending with obvious oak.",88,22.0
474,Testarossa,"A zesty nose of blackberry and mint also shows elements of plum, pencil lead and eucalyptus leaf in this single-vineyard exploration. The food-friendly, earthy and minerally palate offers more pencil lead as well as black pepper, coriander and thyme.",91,64.0
475,Columbia Crest,"This tastes a bit over-cropped; the varietal character is there, but it's a pale rendition. Lightly peppery and grassy, with hints of citrus and very green apple fruit. Straightforward and simple.",84,11.0
476,V. Sattui,"Succulent apricot and creamy vanilla add to the round, full-bodied expression of this robust white wine, the Sémillon blended with 15% Sauvignon Blanc from a single vineyard. A thickness of caramel and more vanilla rises on the finish.",86,26.0
477,Wines & Winemakers,"Fruity and aromatic, this blend of Fernão Pires, Arinto and Sauvignon Blanc is fresh with attractive acidity and also riper tropical fruit and pear flavors. It has a mineral texture that gives the a fine structure. Drink now.",86,12.0
478,Columbia Crest,"Pinot Grigio has yet to find a distinguishing style in Washington State. This is borderline generic, almost beery, a plain, pleasant, fairly neutral white wine with a mix of white peaches and green apples.",85,11.0
479,Chanson Père et Fils,"This attractive, delicate wine features gentle tannins and immediately accessible red-berry fruits. The structure is well integrated into the fruitiness of the wine. Acidity and a jammy strawberry aftertaste suggests this wine will be ready to drink soon. Drink from 2018.",91,125.0
480,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Powerful scents of toast and buttered popcorn dominate the nose, but once in the mouth the wine shows some grip and depth. For those who love the buttery style of Chardonnay, this will be hard to beat at this price. Traces of apple and pear fruit show in the midpalate, and the wine lingers gracefully into a full-bodied finish.",89,26.0
481,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"From the Aegerter domaine, this wine is full of spicy red fruits. It comes from a vineyard in the hills above Nuits Saint-Georges, and the cooler elevation shows in the acidity and fresh fruitiness. The wine is ready to drink.",88,37.0
482,Undurraga,"Nice aromas of floral berry, creamy vanilla and smoky spice work well. The palate is zesty, tight and forward, with saucy red berry flavors and olive. Long, zingy, zesty and saucy on the finish, with herbs, spice and chocolaty flavors. A nice and eager blend of 60% CS and 40% Syrah.",87,12.0
483,Robert Mondavi,"Soft and creamy, with flavors of buttered toast, pineapple marmalade and candy corn. Made in the ripe, oaky, drink-me-now modern style.",87,20.0
484,Undurraga,"Fairly earthy on the nose, with some compost and leafiness to go with chunky berry fruit aromas. The palate is full, simple, chunky and a touch choppy, with cherry, raspberry and vanilla flavors. Creamy if a bit sticky on the finish, but mature and ready to drink",87,40.0
485,Siduri,"Earthy and brawny in pungent compost aromas, this wine has a citrus-laden edge of crisp mineral and bitterroot. Full-bodied and richly layered, its fruit components are dipped in baked rhubarb and black tea.",92,50.0
486,Wines & Winemakers,"Produced from a field blend of old vines (Vinhas Velhas), this rich wine is powerfully structured. It has dark tannins and great concentration, balancing rich plum flavors and acidity with firm structure. This is a wine for serious aging, don't drink before 2020.",92,22.0
487,Fess Parker,"Complex, rich flavors of mulberry, cola, leather, pepper and sandalwood mark this dry, tannic Syrah. The texture is aggressive, with jagged tannins. Ready to drink.",86,28.0
488,Gary Farrell,"Earthy, spicy and big-boned in rich tones of ripe black cherry, licorice and mocha, the wine is fully developed in weight, well-integrated in tannins and hearty, with plenty of power and mouthfilling fruit.",90,55.0
489,Bründlmayer,"Perfumed and fragrant, this is a blend from a number of Kamptal vineyards. It's bright, with an aroma of wild flower that mingles with flavors of currant, crisp apple and mineral-like acidity. Age this for six months or drink it now.",88,23.0
490,Bründlmayer,"A dry, lively, raspberry-flavored wine, with a light mousse. Fruity, fresh and streaked with lemon-zest acidity, it has just the right texture and balance.",88,44.0
491,Chehalem,"A toasty streak of espresso-flavored richness marks this single-vineyard offering. The fruit is ripe and clean, with a tart red-berry flavor at the core.",88,48.0
492,Chehalem,"Surprisingly soft, with an easy-drinking roundness to the midpalate, this is a bit of a butter cookie Chardonnay despite the INOX (stainless steel) moniker. The pretty fruit is the highlight.",88,19.0
493,Chehalem,"Clean and easy drinking, this is created using a fruit from all three estate vineyards. Lightly spicy apple, pear and peach flavors combine gracefully, giving the wine a solid and appealingly fruity core.",88,19.0
494,Concha y Toro,"Toasted aromas include popcorn and baked apple. The palate is medium in weight and features racy acidity and not much midpalate. Flavors of oak-driven spice and white fruits lead to a fast-moving, acidic finish, with leftover spice and resin notes.",86,18.0
495,Georges Duboeuf,"This is a classic, bold, fruity Nouveau, with firm tannins that add weight to the palate. Pair this with food.",86,13.0
496,Williams Selyem,"This is one of the producer's more full-bodied wines, a blend from several sites along Eastside Road, including Calegari, Foss and a new source—Lewis MacGregor Estate. Rich, round and plush, it's as strong as black coffee in its marriage of earthy allspice, baked cherry, blueberry and smoke. Moderate acidity allows for an underlying minerality.",92,55.0
497,Kendall-Jackson,"Stature is always a Bordeaux blend, but varies in vineyard source each year. This '04 is soft, utterly delicious and fully drinkable now. It's rich in black currant, cherry pie filling, plum, anise and spice flavors, generously aged in smoky new oak. Made in the modern style, it will hold effortlessly through 2012, at least.",96,110.0
498,Montes,Simple aromas of tropical fruits and green bean come in front of a spritzy palate with healthy balance. The finish brings notes of bell pepper and lime.,86,13.0
499,Montes,"Everything about this mid-tier Carmenère seems right. The nose deals black-fruit aromas along with black olive, licorice and herbal notes. The mouth is round, friendly and textured, with a mix of roasted plum, berry, herb, spice, olive and tomato flavors. On the finish, it's balanced and tuned up. Drink now–2016.",91,25.0
500,V. Sattui,"This Cabernet wants some time to come together. Right now, it's tannic and oaky, with fresh berry, cherry and dried currant flavors, yet it's very well balanced. Give it 6–8 years.",91,46.0
501,Chateau Ste. Michelle,Pinot Gris has been making inroads in Washington of late and this producer has been leading the way. Pleasing aromas of apple and melon lead to dry full-feeling fruit flavors that linger on the finish.,88,10.0
502,Casa Santos Lima,"A crisp and grassy wine, this is fresh and full of green fruit notes. It is ready to drink now, with grapefruit, gooseberry and crisp apple flavors.",84,
503,Chanson Père et Fils,"Toast and a yeast character gives an edge of bitterness to the fruit. There are hints of smooth melon and acidity, although the lightly burnt character masks the fruitiness.",84,25.0
504,Wines & Winemakers,"There is a sunrise pink color to this soft, rounded wine. Made from Palmela's local Castelão grape, it is fruity, tinged by caramel and a fresh, crisp citrusy aftertaste. Drink now.",84,13.0
505,DFJ Vinhos,"Soft, with a light texture and approachable acidity, this is a bright wine that has plenty of apricot and pear flavors. The wine is fresh and ready to drink, with an orange zest finish.",84,8.0
506,Georges Duboeuf,"This simple wine has some attractive citrus fruit. It is light, bright with plenty of acidity to keep it all fresh. It should be drunk now.",84,22.0
507,Kendall-Jackson,"Straw yellow in color, this widely available wine offers vanilla, lemon curd, honeysuckle and a touch of browned butter on the nose. Once sipped, seared lemon and yellow apple show first, settling into a vanilla cream groove and finishing on a touch of marshmallow.",89,22.0
508,Chanson Père et Fils,"This wine is firm and structured, with complex tannins and dark black-fruit flavors. Under the tannins, juicy fruit with considerable acidity gives signs of great potential. The aftertaste again comes back to the structure. Drink from 2019.",89,70.0
509,Gary Farrell,"A complex, sophisticated Zinfandel, although it's very young, and all the parts haven't come together. Shows luscious waves of ripe forest blackberries, raspberries, red plums and nectarines, with notes of dry chocolate, sweet tobacco, balsam and cedar, finished with massive peppery spices. Notable for the purity and elegance of its tannin-acid structure, this beautiful Zinfandel should age well through 2014.",94,40.0
510,Gary Farrell,"Very rich and dramatic, a fine Pinot, and it's nice to see this veteran winery continue at such a high level. With a near-perfect structure of acidity and tannins, it offers lush flavors of cherries, raspberries, cotton candy, sweet vanilla, granola and cinnamon spices. Grows better and better in the glass.",94,50.0
511,Gary Farrell,"Brilliantly crisp and lushly creamy and honeyed, just a beautiful Chardonnay that offers decadence and sheer deliciousness. Massive in grilled pineapples, green apples, ripe nectarines and butterscotch, brightened with mouthwatering acidity. A joy to drink.",94,32.0
512,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Dark and opulent, this has a modern touch, with soft oak tones that support pretty notes of black cherry, dark chocolate, spice and tobacco. The mouthfeel is rich, toasted and delicious, with a long, dry finish.",92,38.0
513,Gary Farrell,"This is the winery's best Chardonnay, but that's no surprise given its source: the famous Rochioli Vineyard. Right now, it's dominated by new oak influence, with buttered toast, butterscotch and caramel flavors. But there's an intense core of pineapples, oranges, green apples, nectarines and apricots, and the finish is absolutely dry. The vineyard's minerality and the Russian River's acidity provide balance. Give it until the summer of 2013, and then enjoy it for several more years.",92,45.0
514,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Sirica is a newly discovered grape variety that is said to have genetic ties to Teroldego, Syrah and Refosco Friulano. How it ended up in Campania is anyone's guess. Besides the beauty and purity of its cherry aroma, this bold red wine has been carefully embellished by spicy oak and chocolate tones. The finish is long, fresh and rich.",92,
515,Feudi di San Gregorio,"The two grapes that represent the pride of southern Italian winemaking—Fiano and Greco—are blended here to produce a creamy, rich white wine that will pair well with steamed lobster or crab. Beautifully balanced sensations of acidity and spice appear on the long finish.",92,33.0
516,Chehalem,"Back in fine form, this shows crisp and fresh apple, white peach and green melon fruit. Aged in 41% new and 25% one-year-old oak, it's not especially toasty, but has the concentration and balance to develop well over the next six to eight years.",90,40.0
517,DFJ Vinhos,This is a southern and warmer take on Alvarinho than is found in northern Portugal. It brings out the ripe perfumed character of the grape. Apricot and golden plums show both the fruit and the generous texture. Drink this wine starting from late 2017.,90,13.0
518,Williams Selyem,"This lovely, full-bodied white offers generous caramel apple and baked pear flavors cradled in toasted oak that brings nutmeg and vanilla aspects. The rich roundness finds refreshment on the finish in stony acidity.",90,65.0
519,Wines & Winemakers,The wine reveals a serious side to Castelão that is not often shown. Its wood aging and structured character give the wine longevity as well as solid fruits and concentrated tannins. Lightness comes in the form of the acidity and the juicy black fruits. Drink from 2019.,90,18.0
520,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"This is a pale-colored wine—lightly fruity and with a crisp clean texture. It is balanced with acidity and orange-zest flavor, giving the wine a refreshing lift at the end. This is an apéritif style, ready to drink now.",86,13.0
521,Columbia Crest,"A mongrel blend of Syrah, Sangiovese, Grenache and Cabernet Franc, this fruity red has a sweet core of blueberry jam, round and forward and quite appealing. It's dusted with baking spices and fades gently into a soft finish. Hard to imagine a more agreeable bottle of Washington red at this price.",87,8.0
522,Georges Duboeuf,"With crisp black berry fruits, this is pure juice in a glass. It has fresh acidity, a light layer of tannin and a sweet underlay to the attractive fruitiness.",87,
523,Siduri,"This is a complex, muscular wine, with good aging potential. The nose carries a whiff of animal (in a good way) and the black fruits are buoyed with generous acidity. Drink 2020–2028.",91,70.0
524,Siduri,"The vineyard is in the Chehalem Mountains AVA, and here it yields an aromatic wine, with inviting suggestions of buttery cherry pie. It also offers blueberries, a touch of light herb and a deliciously smooth mouthfeel.",91,50.0
525,Robert Mondavi,"Rich and tart, this is a delightful Pinot Noir for drinking now. Feels upscale in the mouth, with flavors of spicy raspberry, red currant, cola and sandalwood. Shows the elegance that almost always accompanies a Robert Mondavi wine.",88,26.0
526,DFJ Vinhos,"This wine heads the range of good value wines under the Monte Alentejano name. It has some weight and a tangy, structured character, and has not lost its black-plum flavors. Drink now.",88,10.0
527,Iron Horse,"This is one of Iron Horse's drier wines, with a low dosage, but it's still fairly sweet. There's a coating of sugar on the raspberries, oranges and limes. The bubbles are a bit scoury now, but this Pinot Noir and Chardonnay blend could develop nuances in the cellar after, say, 2013.",89,50.0
528,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"An eminently quaffable style of Gewürztraminer, this puts the fresh fruit flavors front and center, with floral highlights enriching the nose and the finish. Crisp and clean, it sings out for pad Thai.",89,9.0
529,Kendall-Jackson,"A very nice Pinot Noir that's dry and silky, with satisfying cherry, cola, oak and spice flavors. Not one to age, but fine for drinking now, and easily as good as many Pinots costing more.",87,19.0
530,Gary Farrell,"Fairly light in color and body, this wine sings in fresh cranberry and orange before revealing a meatier underbelly of black tea and sautéed mushroom. Finessed and vibrant in minerality, it has pretty rose and fresh-picked cherry characters that dance on the palate as it evolves and unravels provocatively in the glass.",95,70.0
531,V. Sattui,"Although dry, it seems semisweet, with a honeyed richness to the peach, citrus and vanilla flavors. As Rieslings go, it's soft, compared to German versions, but easy to drink for a weekend brunch.",87,20.0
532,Iron Horse,"Black licorice and orange zest star in this high-toned wine from a singular clone. It's moderate in acidity, with a strong presence of fresh lemon that lingers through the finish.",90,48.0
533,Iron Horse,"With a clarity of fruit and minerality, this wine is brightly floral and noticeably stony, with highlights of melon, lemon and green apple.",90,27.0
534,Wines & Winemakers,"From the northern Vinho Verde region of Melgaço which is the natural heartland of Alvarinho, this tangy, fruity wine bursts with acidity and creamed apple flavors. It is still young, a lively and fruity wine that will benefit from some calming down and broadening out. Drink from the end of 2015.",89,19.0
535,Kendall-Jackson,"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Zinfandel offers lots to like at the price. It's soft, rich and finely tannic, with savory berry and spice flavors that straddle the border between dry and sweet.",85,14.0

537,Siduri,"Spice frames the bone-dry red fruit, which carries a sharp, astringent flavor profile into a rather short, tight finish. More cellar time might help to open this up further.",86,42.0
538,Undurraga,"Waxy, slightly mealy white-fruit aromas set up a pulpy citrusy palate. This offers salty orange and yeasty flavors in front of a finish that's struggling to stay fresh. Drink immediately.",85,10.0
539,Georges Duboeuf,The wine is soft and fruity. Red berry and cherry flavors have a hint of banana as well as the layers of crisp acidity. Drink this fresh wine now.,85,20.0

541,Williams Selyem,"Dark and viscous, this greets the nose with expected aromas of raisin and prune, but rises above with nutmeg, cardamom, clove and sleek graphite notes. The first impression on the palate is sweet plum nectar, but the grippy tannins prove seductive and the ripping acidity keeps it quaffable. The fascinating finish is all about chocolate-covered nuts.",93,40.0
542,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"Subtle notes of concentrated rose petals and almost smoky honeysuckle come with a flinty aspect. The palate is defined by pithy lemon and bergamot interspersed with aromatic spices like lemon pepper and cardamom. It is the zesty core, however, that draws you in, with pithy grapefruit notes that last along with the fruity spice.",90,26.0
543,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"Both rich and opulent, this complex and dense wine is packed with the richest strawberries and a firm, black core of tannin.

544,Louis Jadot,"Already beautiful, this comes from an estate that's managed by Louis Jadot in Puligny-Montrachet, always producing fine wines. It's smooth and toasty, although it is already showing ripe yellow fruits and fragrant acidity. Although drinkable now, it really needs to age, so keep until 2018.",94,125.0
545,Lynmar,"This fresh, supple Pinot comes from a cool Russian River Valley site overlapping the Sonoma Coast AVA. Jenkins sits above the fog line and is rich in Goldridge soils. The wine is lightly mushroomy in earth, and a keen streak of exotic spiciness kicks in convincingly on the finish, after intense and complicated layers of red cherry, raspberry and lavender.",94,70.0
546,Louis Jadot,"Full with dusty tannins from the intensely rocky Aux Cras vineyard, this wine offers rich and rounded fruits. Red berries come through strongly, offering an initially fruit-driven wine that then opens out into one that is dense, very structured and with aging potential. Drink this terroir-driven wine from 2018.",93,80.0
547,Louis Latour,"Big, bold wine, ripe fruits pushed forward by wood, some spice, rich in character. This is lush Chardonnay, but with a good mineral edge.",89,16.0
548,Bründlmayer,"Creamy, rounded freshness with an immensely savory core of sage, arugula and white pepper make for an understated but seriously delicious white. There is weight and importance here, but it is lightly worn. The spicy, almost salty flavors keep you wanting more.",94,25.0
549,Bründlmayer,"A wonderfully breezy, citrusy scent promises far fuller expression in the future. The palate is tightly coiled too, but already vibrates with pepper and herbal spice. Riper notions of yellow plums creep onto the palate but the spiciness and citrus zest remain, making for a truly long, lip-smacking finish.",92,23.0
550,Trapiche,"Trapiche's Broquel line has never featured Pinot Noir before, and maybe this is why. Talk about a sharp, scouring wine. It's lemony and lean, with piercing cranberry flavors and razor-sharp acidity. Crispness is one thing; sharp and edgy is another.",80,17.0
551,Gary Farrell,"It's amazing how rich this is, given the pale, translucent ruby color. Waves of cherries, raspberries, roasted hazelnuts, cola, pomegranates, herb tea, dusty Asian spices and smoky oak change constantly in the glass, as the wine breathes and endlessly fascinates. Bone-dry and tartly crisp, the wine will develop bottle complexities over the next eight years.",95,70.0
552,Foxen,"A streak of bright acidity cuts through the ripe red cherry, currant and cola flavors of this full-bodied, young Pinot Noir. It's aggressive and immature now, with the oak unintegrated with the primary fruit, but has a great future. Give it a minimum of six years in the cellar to knit together.",92,100.0
553,Fess Parker,"Intensely dark and focused, this bottling from Santa Barbara County's historic vineyard is unrivaled in intensity, showing mulberry, elderberry, crushed rock, roast beef and a hint of sagebrush. Full but not sweet boysenberry flavors come through on the palate, balanced by dusty earth, wet stone and more chaparral spice notes.",94,58.0
554,Testarossa,"Los Gatos-based Testarossa is building a powerful reputation as a single-vineyard specialist, but this more accessibly priced cuvée from Monterey County rivals their best efforts. There is nuttiness, brioche and slightly sour orange on the nose, followed by a very soft mouthfeel, with flavors of pound cake, vanilla cookie, peach cobbler and candied grapefruit.",92,23.0
555,Louis Latour,"This powerful, spicy wine offers structure and a thrust of wood. Firm and dark, as befits a Vosne-Romanée, it is densely powerful, full of black fruits that are already shining above the structure. Drink from 2017.",92,145.0
556,Louis Latour,"Corton Grancey is the site of Louis Latour's winery and has a long tradition in the family's hands. This 2011 is powerful and solid while offering very ripe and jammy fruits. Attractive acidity cuts through the richness and contrasts with the finely modulated structure. It has good aging potential, drink from 2018.",92,140.0
557,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"What to mention first? A hint of mossy earth, chamomile tisane, Cox Orange Pippin apples or lemon zest? All of these aromas dance on the nose. They are still totally shy on the taut, dry and concentrated palate. For now, it is mossy citrus that is most aromatic while rich fruit still needs to unfurl. This strikes a note of utter purity, of something soaring and bright. Right now this is totally brisk, invigorating and refreshing but its true colors won't show for some time. Drink 2020–2035.",96,120.0
558,Williams Selyem,"This wine shows a high degree of spiciness with a rose petal-like flourish—a stellar first effort from a new estate vineyard along Eastside Road. Brambly raspberry and dark cherry flavors seem brushed by a subtle waft of campfire smoke and molten chocolate, all swirling together in the glass as a lengthy, lively palate framed by acidity.",96,85.0
559,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"The wine is firm and structured while still having fresh juicy fruitiness. Wood and fruit tannins give a dense core of dryness, leaving the acidity and red berry fruits still developing. From one of the best Premier Crus in Pommard, this will be best drunk after 2018.",91,141.0
560,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"Richly juicy, this offers a combination of ripe red and black fruits and dark, dense tannins. It's a solid, complex wine with a strong sense of minerality as well as opulent fruitiness. Drink this potentially delicious wine from 2017.",91,
561,Lynmar,"The winery's high-end cuvée, this is a five-barrel blend, three of the barrels new. Dancing in cardamom and dark cherry, the background ripe and toasty, the flavors are exotic and long lingering. There's a tension and intensity to this wine that bests speaks to aging, or a full decant; either way, it'll be delicious.",91,100.0
562,Lynmar,"The winery's most accessible and available Pinot Noir—still quite small in production—is from several vineyards, including single-vineyard sites like Jenkins. It offers classic Russian River Valley cola spice and bright aromatics and acidity, the texture soft and structured, a smaller percentage of new French oak used for aging.",91,40.0
563,Trapiche,"Spice, licorice and herbal notes complement red-fruit aromas, while the palate offers plenty of structure and tannic grab. There's an avalanche of blackberry, cassis, fig, chocolate and herbal flavors to process, while the finish is rich and rewarding before breaking up in bits.",90,15.0
564,Concha y Toro,"Foxy, lightly green aromas of cherry and tomato are racy and raw. This Malbec has a grating feel, while herbal, oaky red-berry and plum flavors are foxy. A choppy, aggressive finish is led by herbal berry flavors.",86,17.0
565,DFJ Vinhos,"Fresh, crisp Arinto gives a fine lemon and sliced apple character to this light soft wine. With its bright fruit, crisp acidity and tangy texture, it is totally ready to drink.",86,10.0
566,Chehalem,"The RR wines receive special packaging, but little technical information is provided. Though this is a 2013, it's of a piece with the winery's 2014 Pinots, which is to say that lemony acids and a plethora of herbal components overshadow the fruit. There are hints of wild berry, and a finish with light suggestions of chocolate.",87,79.0
567,DFJ Vinhos,"Ripe and fruity, with some sweetness that does not seem to be fully integrated. So the green plum flavors are attractive, as is the acidity, but there is an intrusive sugary edge.",83,8.0
568,Iron Horse,"A beautiful wine, this is rich in citrus, tropical fruit and green apple flavors, with a smoky jacket of oak. The acids and tannins lift it above the ordinary, as does a stony minerality that tastes of the soil.",93,48.0
569,Iron Horse,"This is a beautiful Chardonnay—dry, sleek and refined. Beyond the subtle tropical fruit, citrus and green apple flavors is a steely minerality and lemony acidity that get the mouth watering. Drink now.",93,48.0
570,Wines & Winemakers,"This 100% Touriga Nacional comes from the government-owned estate in the north of Tejo. Named after the barn owl that is found in the woods, the wine is structured with dense tannins as well as concentrated black fruits. It is balanced with its fruit and structure already working well together, but it will need time. Drink from 2019.",93,36.0
571,Wines & Winemakers,This fine low-production wood-aged wine is almost Burgundian in its creamy richness. The toast is nicely judged giving a wine that has just enough acidity and has plenty of textured apple and grapefruit flavors. The wine is named after the year of the creation of the Companhia das Lezirias.,93,77.0
572,Siduri,"Juicy, tart and crisp with acidity, this is a standout vineyard designate with a bold, velvety texture. Blue fruit-driven, it's full-bodied and fleshy in all the best ways, with a plush finish that teases with cardamom and tea.",93,50.0
573,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"Ripe luscious pear fruit almost has a touch of maple syrup on the nose. The palate, which still has ample carbon dioxide from the fermentation for a little fizz, is light and fresh, lemony and bouncy, alive with a kind of earthy goodness. It is the lemon that lasts longest on the dry refreshing palate and makes for a lip-smacking finish.",93,40.0
574,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"The nose is subdued. Even the palate only gives up its secrets slowly. Right now, there is a creamy richness informed by peach and mirabelle plum. It is framed by zesty lemon freshness that counters the palpable warmth. The body is concentrated and lip smacking, harmonious and moreish with an earthy, clean, textured and off-dry finish.",93,55.0
575,Lynmar,"Named for the winery's co-proprietor and founder, Lynn's is powerfully graceful, much like the man himself, offering seamless texture and length. Full bodied and complex, it's structured and ripely satisfying in its mix of black tea, grenadine and feral evocations of a walk in the woods.",94,85.0
576,Chanson Père et Fils,"Structured and dense with tannins, this is a big wine with a big future. Its black fruits, acidity and solid texture all point to its weight and richness. It is going to be a rich fruity wine. But wait until 2023.",92,32.0
577,Foxen,"Very fresh although not particularly fruity aromas of raspberry mesh with allspice, thyme and tarragon on the nose of this block-designate bottling from the historic vineyard. Energetic and lighter red-fruit flavors like pomegranate show on the sip, where fennel is the dominant spice.",92,65.0
578,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Enticing aromas of violet, dark-skinned berry, chopped herb and clove lead the nose while the vibrant palate offers wild cherry, black raspberry, licorice and a hint of ground pepper. Polished tannins support the savory flavors.",89,23.0
579,Kendall-Jackson,"Starts off a bit green and stemmy in aroma, and in the mouth, tannins overwhelm the cherry-berry fruit. Good and dry, but a bit underripe and simple. Drink now.",85,18.0
580,Testarossa,"This wine's distinct and intriguing nose pairs cola and cinnamon with cranberry, chopped chaparral scrub and wildfire smoke. That scrubby character of green sage and mugwort extends to the palate, spicing up the beet juice, ripe raspberries and a pencil-lead backbone.",93,64.0
581,Gary Farrell,"Crisp undercurrents of tangerine, grapefruit and cranberry provide a brightness and light to this wine, which is velvety-smooth on the palate. An inaugural release for the producer from this vineyard, it bristles with cinnamon and clove, delving into black pepper spiciness as well. Drink this structured wine now through 2023.",93,70.0
582,Lynmar,"Flinty lemon and caramel are flouted around rich layers of caramel and baked quince in this blend of two vineyard sites, both planted to Wente selection Chardonnay. The richness of the vineyards speaks loudly enough to call for only neutral oak to be used in aging. The finish brings a spark of pineapple and mango custard.",93,70.0
583,Testarossa,"An oily character of tangerine skin, peach flesh and condensed nuts meets with caramel, pinched soda and cut stone-fruit freshness on the nose of this top bottling from the Los Gatos producer. The palate shows ripe Granny Smith apple flesh, seared pears and almond oil, with a sea-salt splash on the finish.",93,70.0
584,Testarossa,"The fantastic nose pitches French toast together with Meyer lemon pith, crushed rock, struck match and a slight sour-cream element. This wine is immediately lively on the tongue, with lots of but not overdone acidity. Yeasty toast flavors are cut by lemon and poached pear on a racy and focused palate.",93,48.0
585,Wines & Winemakers,"A serious and dense wine, this is rich and full of dark juicy fruit. It has plenty of structure of course, with its rich tannins and wood aging flavors right up front. The acidity is perfumed, underlining the ripe fruit. Drink this concentrated wine from 2018.",93,18.0
586,Georges Duboeuf,"Aromas of bananas follow through to the palate of this wine, spoiling the structured black plums and tannins. The wine is fresh and juicy, with some dry structure at the background. Drink from 2016.",85,24.0
587,Georges Duboeuf,"This wine has structure and freshness although the fruit is on the lean side, offering black cherries and swathes of crisp acidity. The aftertaste is juicy, fresh and mineral.",85,
588,Georges Duboeuf,"While there is a good structure here, this wine is spoiled by banana flavors that dominate the otherwise attractive red berry fruits. Acidity and a dry tannic core suggest some aging, so maybe the wine will round out.",85,20.0
589,Louis Jadot,"This wine is fruity although it also has weight and a rich strand of spice and red plum-skin tannins. This 100% Gamay could age at least until early 2016, although one can just drink it now.",85,13.0
590,Montes,"Angular on the nose, with earthy, semisharp red fruit aromas that are undoubtedly Pinot-related. The palate offers good depth and only slightly jagged acids, and the flavors of raspberry are snappy and just a bit herbal. Dry, toasty and endearing on the finish.",88,24.0
591,Albert Bichot,"Fine, solidly textured wine that has some depth of red fruit flavors as well as some sweetness. The tannin edge is on the dry side, with some obvious toast character, giving a wine that needs 2–3 years aging.",88,
592,Concha y Toro,"Sweet and ripe in aromatics, with notes of maple and inky black fruit scents. The palate is rock-solid and thick, with a good texture, tannic grip and flavors of cassis, berry and leather. Composed and medium-long on the sturdy finish. A mix of 85% Cab and 15% Syrah.",88,14.0
593,Chehalem,"Flavors roll from cranberry to sweet red cherry in a red-fruit riot. It was aged in 52% new and 24% one-year-old oak, but it's unobtrusive and not especially toasty. The barrel time has begun to smooth out any bumps and rough edges, though a touch of phenolic bite remains. Drink from 2018 to 2022.",90,70.0
594,Iron Horse,"From a replanted block of the vineyard, this wine is zesty, savory and high in acidity. With a backbone of stony texture and a deep core of licorice and strawberry flavors, it's bold in tannins and intensity, yet finishes bright.",90,85.0
595,Iron Horse,"It's clear that winemaker Forrest Tancer is aiming at a California-class Cabernet blend, a complex wine, lush in fruit and herbs, softly tannic and framed in the finest oak. He largely succeeds with this bottling, made only in the best vintages. It lacks the structure of Napa Cabernet, which is unavoidable given its terroir. But it defines Alexander Valley.",92,56.0
596,Kunde,"Partially barrel fermented and aged on the lees, this Chard has a creamy texture, and good flavors of pears, pineapples, figs and vanilla. Brisk acidity makes the finish clean and tart.",85,17.0
597,Concha y Toro,"Horsey aromas infringe upon basic cherry and tomato scents. This is lean on the palate, with scouring acidity. Tart, spicy plum and cherry flavors end on a crisp, dilute finish with that reverberates with sour plum and cherry notes.",85,11.0
598,Kendall-Jackson,"Lots of oaky flavors mark this dry wine. Buttered toast, brown butter and vanilla flavors dominate the underlying peach, pear, citrus and mango flavors.",86,22.0
599,Gary Farrell,"Great structure marks this lush, young Pinot Noir. Crisp acidity and refined, firm tannins give it a solid framework, and the flavors are delicious. Shows pie-filling cherries, black raspberries, currants and mocha, with spicy cinnamon and anise. Will age for up to a decade.",92,65.0
600,Wines & Winemakers,"Winemaker Leonor Freitas runs her vineyard just south of Lisbon. This soft, fruity blend is light in both tannins and acidity. It's fresh in character, giving a ripe wine that is ready to drink now.",85,12.0
601,Fess Parker,"This wine comes from a single vineyard in the western part of the appellation. Aromas suggest honeysuckle, lemon cream sauce and a wild array of garden herbs and spices, from scallions and green garlic to fresh oregano. It's light and bright on the palate, with a steely focus of lime juice on peach.",92,37.0
602,Undurraga,"Pushy, forceful aromas of vanilla and oak blend with berry and spice notes. The palate is quietly full bodied, with plum and spice flavors in front of a toasty, dry, nicely oaked finish. For a lively, nervy wine, this is honest and good.",87,16.0
603,Louis Latour,"This is a beautiful, rounded and soft wine with sweet fruits and gentle tannins. Embedded in the intense fruitiness, a solid structure will help the wine age. Drink from 2016.",89,75.0
604,Louis Latour,"In this ripe wine, solid tannins are attractively balanced with red fruits. It does have a cool character from the vineyard, showing structure as well as delicious fruitiness. Drink from 2016.",89,50.0
605,Chanson Père et Fils,"From vines close to the premier crus, this is firm and solid while generous. It conveys power and structure along with a more delicious, perfumed side. Drink from 2017.",89,24.0
606,Undurraga,"Snappy aromas of spring peas and fresh herbs come with punchy citrus scents. This is a full-volume, summertime wine that's in good shape. Loud citrus flavors, particularly grapefruit, turn chunky before falling off on the finish. Drink now.",86,10.0
607,Santa Ema,"Loamy, soft aromas of plum and berry don't show much punch. In the mouth, this is mostly fresh, with a solid feel. Flavors of plum, raspberry, red currant and herbal notes skew toward red, while a punchy, bright finish is upbeat. This is 75% Cabernet Sauvignon, 18% Carmenère and 7% Cabernet Franc.",89,50.0
608,DFJ Vinhos,"This dark, structured wine, with its balanced blend of Touriga Nacional, Touriga Franca and Tinta Roriz, is firm with tannins and dense berry fruits. Full in the mouth, it is a concentrated wine that brings out a strongly chalky texture. The wine is still moving towards a rich future. Drink from 2017.",90,10.0
609,Columbia Crest,"On first pour, the aromas of toast, char, spice and herb show some reduction that blows off over time. The purple-fruit flavors are lighter in style, showing a pleasing sense of purity, with the concentration dipping in the middle before coming back together on the finish.",88,40.0
610,Santa Ema,"From head to toe, creamy, candied oak is the driver of this resiny Merlot. Aromas of vanilla and sweet plastic are front and center on the nose, while flavors of clove, vanilla and maple syrup carry onto the finish without mellowing.",84,15.0
611,Testarossa,"This is a blend of several vineyards, instead of the winery's usual single-vineyard Chards. It's been tastefully assembled, and displays good Central Coast acidity framing tropical fruit and oak flavors with a stony, minerally edge.",87,30.0
612,Iron Horse,"Made with a classic Champagne blend of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, this is the simplest of Iron Horse's bubblies. It's elegant, and should be consumed in its youth.",87,31.0
613,V. Sattui,"You can taste the warm sunshine in the spicy berry flavors of this Zin. It comes right up to the edge of overripe, with suggestions of bitter raisins, then pulls back to let the cassis and cherry liqueur shine through.",87,33.0
614,Undurraga,"Pungent and green up front, with a shot of cool-coast pyrazines on the nose, this hits the palate with a lemony blast of citric acid. Flavors of orange and nettle are a touch briny, while a juicy, acidic, peppery finish is racy to the max.",89,21.0
615,Georges Duboeuf,"This firm wine has smoky tannins and red-currant acidity. It is still young, its structure still dry and solid. Wait until the end of 2016 before drinking.",86,22.0
616,Kendall-Jackson,"Polished aromas of roasted nuts, sea salt, Meyer lemon peel and onion skin show on the nose of this widely available bottling from the Chardonnay kings. The sip is a little bit flat in terms of texture and acidity, but there are compelling and satisfying flavors of roasted walnuts and pecans, with a citrusy acidity that rises toward the finish.",87,28.0
617,Foxen,"This dry-farmed vineyard is often challenging for Winemaker Billy Wathen, but it worked this vintage, showing bright and ripe aromas of apple blossom, pear, honey and sweet lemon, all underlined by white-rock minerality. The lively palate shows lime soda and chalk flavors, with a pear-skin bitterness and ample acidity, which keeps the mouth tingling deep into the finish.",92,37.0
618,DFJ Vinhos,"Hand-selected bunches from the Porto Franco estate of DFJ Vinhos went into this complex wine. It has solid tannins and a firm black-fruit character. The wood aging shows well and is already balanced, melding the fruit and structure together. Drink now.",92,25.0
619,Casa Santos Lima,"Structured, this oozes blackberry fruitiness as well as a balanced layer of dry tannins. The wine is fruity and rich while keeping its elegance. A core of tannins and fresh acidity in the fruit promise that this wine will age. Drink from 2017.",92,26.0
620,Concha y Toro,"Charred and heavily oaked from the opening gun to the closing tape. Amid all the barrel influence and toast, you'll find black plum and wild berry aromas and flavors. On the finish, oak reasserts its control over this wine.",87,18.0
621,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"Big and rich, this is a broad, open version of Corton-Charlemagne, a powerhouse of ripe white and yellow fruits. It seems initially without enough depth, a product of its youth, then gradually the ripe structure shows through, promising aging over 6–7 years.",94,305.0
622,Lynmar,"Shows the gorgeousness of fruit this vineyard always delivers, as well as the seemingly impossible balancing act of feminine generosity and structural power. The result will be evident to anyone who loves Pinot Noir. This is a massive wine, ripe with red fruits and berries and mocha, but it's also worthy of aging. Give it at least six years.",94,70.0
623,Lynmar,"An awesome wine that shows the power of the estate vineyard, yet with a deft, elegant touch. You can't help but be dazzled by the intense raspberry, cherry, red currant and cola flavors. Yet the acid-tannin balance is superb, lifting the wine into a thoroughly enjoyable complexity. Drink now, with decanting, and over the next eight years.",94,70.0
624,V. Sattui,"Sleepy and tannic, this wine is elusive in fruit both aromatically and on the palate, showing more green, herbal character than cherry or berry. Still, it is hugely full bodied and wrapped forcefully in oak, providing a dry finish.",84,75.0
625,Santa Ema,"Tropical aromas of melon, pineapple juice and canned pears are friendly. A fresh palate with minimal depth and weight offers simple apple and white-grape flavors prior to a lean, melony tasting finish.",84,9.0
626,Fess Parker,"Winemaker Blair Fox loves this single-clone bottling, and for good reason. It's intensely dark in color but not overextracted, with soil, eucalyptus, black plum and baking spice aromas. Rounded strawberry and raspberry fruit shows on the medium-bodied palate, with star anise and white pepper accents.",94,55.0
627,Testarossa,"Winemaker Bill Brosseau hits a single vineyard home run with this bottling from one of the Central Coast's oldest sites. It shows exotic plum, tangy cranberry, pine needle, juniper and pencil shaving scents on the nose. The palate is steeped in mulberry, marjoram and curry-like Indian spices, proving dynamic and delicious in the most compelling ways.",94,65.0
628,Chanson Père et Fils,"Serious, concentrated fruit and structure on this grand cru Chablis. White fruits, laced with lime and rounded with some toast, all contribute to a powerful, complex wine.",92,85.0
629,Kendall-Jackson,"Classic Monterey Pinot, dry, crisp, silky and ripe. The fine 2007 vintage has made it explosive in cherries, currants, sassafras and cola, with refined, new oak notes of smoke and spice. Drink this rich wine now through 2013.",92,35.0
630,Kendall-Jackson,"It's all there with this rich Merlot. Fabulously lush in currants, mocha and cedar, it also displays great balance and charm. The tannins are superfine. Drink this beauty now through 2010.",92,50.0
631,Testarossa,"This is a blend of Testarossa's far-flung vineyards across California, hence the statewide appellation. It's extraordinarily rich and explosive in apricots, pineapples, guavas, nectarines, buttered toast and smoky, caramelized oak. So muscular that you might want to age it for a year or two, to let it calm down.",92,55.0
632,Testarossa,"This is one of the bigger, more powerful Chardonnays out there in the market. It's triumphant in ripe pineapple jam, apricot-infused crème brûlée, Meyer lemon custard, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors, wrapped into a creamy rich texture that finishes dry and crisp. May lack subtlety, but what immense pleasure it offers.",92,44.0
633,Santa Ema,"Spicy, herbal plum and cassis aromas mix in notes of olive and wet dog fur. This is more spunky and fresh than dense. Leafy berry, plum and olive are the key flavors on this Carmenère-led blend that finishes herbal and spicy, with high-toned residual acidity.",90,24.0
634,Albert Bichot,"With some firm structure, this wine also has great fruitiness. It offers plenty of raspberry fruits, good acidity and a solid texture of tannins. The acidity keeps the wine perfumed and fresh. Drink the wine from 2019.",90,80.0
635,Chanson Père et Fils,"Aromas of this wine show considerable wood. On the palate, the wood is very present, giving acidity as well as layers of toast and spice. Hints of yellow fruit show through, suggesting the possibility of a ripe, rich wine in the future. Drink from 2019.",90,59.0
636,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"With almost half of this wine aged in new French oak, it's barrel forward with notes of char and caramel along with tropical fruit. This fruit expression helps to retain a sense of elegance that carries through the finish.",89,22.0
637,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"About 5% Viognier is blended into this spicy, round and fruity Pinot Gris. Complex and lively flavors suggest lemon and orange peel, melon, pear, and a hint of vanilla.",89,11.0
638,Chanson Père et Fils,"Classic Meursault, big and bold with a rounded texture. That said, the wine does have a crisp edge of green apples to balance the spiced toast, which is very evident at this stage.",87,60.0
639,Fess Parker,"Cherry liqueur, candied rose petals, rhubarb, sweet truffle and wet earth converge for a very sultry and dynamic nose on this bottling, showing that quite a bit of complexity can come from one clone. Well-integrated flavors of dark red fruit, vanilla and nutmeg show on the sip, which is woven together by persistent acidity.",92,58.0
640,Siduri,"Give this Pinot  Noir a couple of years to knit together. Right now it's a little acidic, and it offers flavors of Life Savers candy, raspberry and cherry. The mouthfeel is velvety smooth.",89,52.0
641,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"This vineyard-designated wine includes 13% Cabernet Sauvignon and 9% Syrah. The Syrah component seems to take over, in the form of tart berry, herb and dried leaf flavors. The alcohol, which is 15.5%, mutes any other complexities. It's a nice wine, but it doesn't offer standard Washington Merlot flavors.",88,28.0
642,Siduri,"This wine combines ripe raspberry and cherry flavors with sweet, smoky oak tones. A wine to drink now, it shows classic Russian River acidity, and it bears a minerally, salty profile that lends structural elegance.",88,32.0
643,Albert Bichot,"The wine has a bitter edge with a burnt character that clashes with the red fruit and banana flavors. Maybe better in a few months, but by then, of course, it will have been drunk.",83,10.0
644,Concha y Toro,"Spiky aromas of brambly, herbal berry fruits introduce a thick yet juicy palate with herbal, spicy flavors of berry and mild green notes. On the finish, this is fresh in feel, with a minty aftertaste.",87,11.0

647,DFJ Vinhos,"Rich and bold, it's a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Tinta Roriz, both giving a floral character as well as some concentrated tannins. The dry structure and the intense acidity at the end suggest some aging. Drink from 2015.",88,9.0
648,Lynmar,"The cool vintage has kept this wine tart in acidity; and there may even be a touch of botrytis, to judge from the golden apricot note that rides over the pears, limes and buttery cream. Bone dry and minerally, it's an elegant, Chablis-style wine for drinking now.",91,30.0
649,Lynmar,"An enormous Pinot Noir that's rich and ripe in cherries, red currants, licorice, cola and sweet toasty oak, and thoroughly dry on the finish. There's no doubting its layers of complexity, although it's a little warm with alcohol. Could be an ager. Try after 2016.",91,70.0
650,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"The price on the Ethos Reserve has dropped significantly, making it an especially good value for a full-on, toasty and buttery Chardonnay. A harmonious mélange of tree fruits and tropical nuances—papaya and banana stand out—with a smooth and luscious mouthfeel.",90,25.0
651,Robert Mondavi,"Appealing aromas of blueberry and vanilla make for a very solid Bordeaux blend. Flavors of plum, cranberry and pomegranate lead into a licorice finish.",87,11.0
652,Santa Ema,"Saturated purple in color and grapy on the nose. The palate is mouthfilling but carries semisharp acidity, and the flavors run in the direction of standard black fruit. Notes of mocha and coconut soften the finish, and overall this is a good but rather generic wine.",86,12.0
653,Santa Ema,"Aromas of crusty blackberry are dark and herbal, while the palate is zesty and fresh, with tight acidity supporting flavors of cassis, black cherry, cola nut and pepper. Toasty, herbal and licorice-like on the finish. A good yet common wine.",86,12.0
654,Fess Parker,"With all of the buttered toast, buttered popcorn and butterscotch flavors, this Chardonnay's fruit isn't allowed to speak. It has brisk acidity and rich tangerine and mango flavors, but the winemaker's hand feels heavy.",85,35.0
655,Georges Duboeuf,"With light tannins and herbal fruit flavors, this is a crisp, tight wine. Red-berry flavors show through along with a greener character and tannins that are not quite ripe. Drink now.",83,12.0
656,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Dried stone fruit, McIntosh apple and lemon blossom aromas lead the nose on this richly textured dessert wine. On the palate, notes of cinnamon, toasted almond and mineral add depth to candied nectarine zest and Linden honey. Refreshing acidity balances this out.",91,63.0
657,Wines & Winemakers,"Dominated by juicy Castelão, this lightly structured wine has fine tannins to propel the berry fruits up to the front. It is rich and full-bodied with a touch of pepper from the alcohol. The aftertaste brings out fresh acidity and softness.",88,11.0
658,Georges Duboeuf,"This is a young wine, full of fruit and still packed with dry tannins. Its future is good, with layers of juicy ripe black cherry flavors under the tannins that promise a ripe and full-bodied wine. Drink from 2016.",88,
659,Georges Duboeuf,"Only the juice at the heart of the pressing is used to make this attractive and ripely fruity wine. It has a soft, full texture with juicy acidity and generous tannins. The wine is dense, packed with red plum and berry flavors and finished with just the right, fresh acidity. Drink now.",88,15.0
660,Iron Horse,"One whiff tells you this bubbly is in a league of its own. It’s not the toast or the lees, not the lime-scented fruit or the doughy notes; it’s something indefinable, but complex and refined. That pedigree carries through in the mouth, where the fruit is modulated. The impression is of acidity and elegance, although the fruit shows up in the finish. Terrific now, but has the balance and harmony to last for a lot longer.",93,60.0
661,Iron Horse,"This lovely wine has classic green-apple and lime aromas that are fully developed, with a nice backdrop of yeast and dough. In the mouth, it’s very rich. At eight years, the acids and tannins have modulated, leaving behind a creamy texture. And yet it’s still young and will age.",92,34.0
662,Siduri,"An atypically oaky wine for Siduri, with a rich veneer of French oak overlying black cherries, cola and spice. The intensity builds on the palate, where root beer and black cherries culminate in a long, smoky-spicy finish. Needs a couple of years to pull itself together, but the raw materials are all there.",91,49.0
663,Chehalem,"Earthy and engaging, and a little bit rugged. Aromas of barnyard and Middle Eastern tahini set up a palate full of spiced-up curranty fruit. Light oak shows itself early in a finish that unfolds in layers, revealing complexity and class.",90,25.0
664,Casa Santos Lima,"Freshly aromatic, this is a Portuguese equivalent of a Gewürztraminer. It has all the lychees and spice as well as a thick, almost viscous texture. Good acidity helps the balance. Delicious, as an apéritif or with Asian food.",89,
665,DFJ Vinhos,"This is a smooth wine, soft with just a hint of tannins and with plenty of juicy acidity. Black-currant fruitiness dominates this crisp, clean and ready to drink wine.",84,18.0
666,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"This firmly structured wine is packed with solid tannins as well as ripe juicy red fruits. It comes from the upper part of the Rugiens Premier Cru, one of the top sites in Pommard. Dense and needing to age, the wine will be ready from 2023.",93,103.0
667,Louis Latour,"Rich and rounded with a creamy texture, this wine is ripe with apricots and has a strongly mineral character. Full of fruit, the wine also has a texture that means it needs to age. Drink from 2021.",93,90.0
668,Louis Latour,"Among the most northerly of the run of Beaune premier crus, the wine is structured but the structure is cushioned by the ripe red-berry fruits to give a generous wine. Backed by tannins, the wine will age well. Drink from 2022.",93,80.0
669,Siduri,"Deep and hearty aromas of blackberry, candied violet and dried lavender are enhanced by a touch of roasted pork on the nose of this red by Adam Lee. The full-bodied palate is framed by soft yet structural tannins and a slow-rising acidity, showing dark berries, charred beef and a hint of licorice.",93,55.0
670,Louis Latour,"This is a cool wine, with acidity and citrus fruits well in evidence. It comes from one of the higher premier-cru vineyards, giving a crisp and textured wine even in this warm vintage. It needs time. Drink from 2020.",93,90.0
671,Louis Latour,"This crisp wine comes from one of upper vineyards of the village. It is packed with apples and citrus, plus a touch of toast. With lively acidity, this wine will age well. Drink from 2021.",93,90.0
672,Albert Bichot,"This young, textured wine shows a mix of strong minerality and ripe white fruits. The Albert Bichot Chablis domaine has a fine parcel from this premier cru. Refreshing citrus and tight acidity contrast with the warmer vanilla and yellow fruits. Drink from 2021.",93,45.0
673,Georges Duboeuf,"A smooth, fruity wine, with fine red-cherry flavors and very soft tannins. It is spoiled by a banana flavor that intrudes into the fresh fruit.",84,
674,Georges Duboeuf,"The banana aromas are off-putting in this light, juicy wine. Although there are tannins, they are not enough to make sense of the simple, jammy fruit.",84,
675,Georges Duboeuf,"Heavy and waxy, with overdone varietal aromas that seem oily. Lots of pepper and cumin, but what about the fruit and acidity? Nowhere to be found.",80,10.0
676,Columbia Crest,"Flavors of plum, cherry, cassis, chalky earth, smoke and bell pepper. Still tight and chewy, with suggestions that the fruit from this difficult vintage didn’t attain full ripeness. A good effort from a subpar year, marked by a hint of brett on the finish.",87,16.0
677,Testarossa,"Something special from the west side of the Salinas Valley, with its fogs and wind. Drinks very bright in acids and even some tannins that frame a melange of flavors, including sweet lime, green apple, and the ripest white peach. Tastes leesy and has the texture of sweet cream. This distinctive wine defines Monterey's interpretation of Chardonnay.",93,35.0
678,Gary Farrell,"Blue fruit and high acidity open this delightful Pinot Noir, from a cool section of the Russian River Valley overlapping Green Valley. The oak imprint is low, yet the wine offers firm structure and elegance, remaining subdued and fresh on the palate in swirls of dark cherry, boysenberry and earthy leather.",90,55.0
679,Siduri,"There's an intensity of cola-cinnamon spice and clove within the aromas and flavors of this single-vineyard designate, intriguing invites to explore further. Pure, crisp and focused raspberry and earth follow, with a subtle use of oak that allows the fruit and varietal exoticness to speak.",90,48.0
680,Montes,"Chile's first high-profile, high-priced Carmenère has proven itself to be an excellent wine. The '05 has a slight herbal DNA, but there's plenty of oak, vanilla, raw fruit and texture to cover that up. On the palate, blackberry, prune and fine herbs comprise the flavors, while the finish turns thick and dense. With 8% Petit Verdot, Purple Angel continues to press the case for high-end Chilean Carmenère.",91,48.0
681,Testarossa,"Made in the Sleepy Hollow style, extraordinarily ripe, almost botrytized in apricot and honey flavors like a dessert wine, except that it's bone dry. Really epitomizes this vineyard and corner of Monterey, where Chard ripens to beautifully while maintaining acidity.",91,39.0
682,Columbia Crest,"It is amazing that 134,000 cases of this budget bottling can be made to this level of quality. From a classic vintage, it's structured and substantial, overcoming the somewhat overdone vanilla flavors with great fruit and firm acids.",86,8.0
683,Columbia Crest,"With buttered popcorn scents and flavors, underscored with pretty, toasty oak, this marries those flavors to a more restrained body, balanced with good acidity and showing fruit flavors of green apple and banana cream pie. Not a complex wine, but forward and flavorful.",88,20.0
684,Louis Jadot,"Fresh and bright, dominated by its citrus and almond flavors. It has a soft, creamy texture, with highlights of orange zest, green plums and a great burst of acidity.",88,15.0
685,Louis Jadot,"Ripe wine, pushing its toast, pear and apricot flavors. Smooth, with an English walnut taste, and green herb acidity. Ready to drink now.",87,14.0
686,Columbia Crest,"Quite firm and focused, with a dominating scent of cut tobacco. The black cherry fruit is set against juicy acids, and rolls into a finish with streaks of licorice and more of that cut tobacco flavor.",87,15.0
687,Casa Santos Lima,"A mixed bag of varieties went into this soft and fruity wine. It has gentle tannins that are lifted by acidity and black currant fruitiness. With its lifestyle label (a small Vespa motor scooter), it is obviously meant to be an easy-going ready-to-drink wine. And it succeeds.",87,10.0
688,Undurraga,"This medium-weight Chard is fresh and mildly dusty smelling, with aromas of pear and apple. The palate is lifted, fresh in feel and offers punchy acidity in front of lime, gooseberry and herb flavors. For under $20, this is nicely made and hints at elegance.",88,16.0
689,Concha y Toro,"Toast, black fruit and herbal aromas are 100% typical of value-priced Merlot from Chile. This feels fresh, wiry and a bit choppy, while herbal plum and raspberry flavors come with touches of licorice, mint, toast and anise.",86,12.0
690,Kendall-Jackson,"KJ's Avant bottling is refreshing with fruity essence, showing sweet flavors of honey, peaches, apricots and nectarines. With only a touch of oak, it has a bright, fresh mouthfeel that makes it especially attractive.",86,17.0
691,DFJ Vinhos,"This soft and fruity wine is crisp, fragrant and fresh. It has light acidity that balances with the forward apple flavor, as well as a dry lime edginess and nervy texture. Drink now. Screwcap.",86,8.0
692,Kendall-Jackson,"A nice, bright and savory Sauvignon Blanc, rich in fruit but dry on the finish. Shows waves of Meyer lemon, pineapple, kiwi, honeysuckle and vanilla flavors, accented with a touch of oak. Enjoyable on its own or with little appetizers.",87,20.0
693,Siduri,"Dusty plum flavors meet baked bread aromas in this tightly-wound, tense vineyard-designated wine. It's marked by an undercurrent of pomegranate and rhubarb, the texture taking on more savory tones of forest and black tea as it finishes.",90,50.0
694,Siduri,"A waft of freshly baked baguette unfurls on the nose of this wine, followed by sautéed mushroom scents, giving it earthy character. Soft and round on the palate, the fruit tends toward darker, lusher notes of blueberry and plum.",90,49.0
695,Bründlmayer,"One of Bründlmayer's specialities is the lyre training system, which opens out the canopy to get the maximum exposure. It gives a wine that has extra intensity, flavors of white currants vying with lychees, almonds, a perfumed aura. The end is satisfying, with acidity adding a lift.",94,58.0
696,V. Sattui,"Not an easy wine to appreciate now. It's tannic, and the fruit is fresh and primary, with the sweet, candied taste of a chewy raspberry twist. Still, there's something complex and interesting going on. It's not just another overripe Zin. Give it a year or two to come around.",89,40.0
697,Wines & Winemakers,"Made from 100% Castelâo, the local grape of Setúbal, this wine is attractively fruity, with a crisp texture. Warmer, ripe red-berry fruits contrast with the acidity, leaving a balanced wine that is ready to drink.",85,11.0
698,DFJ Vinhos,"Perfumed, soft, easy wine, showing the juicy, fresh side of the two grapes. The fruits are more red than black, open and ripe, but still with youthful exuberance and great freshness.",88,
699,Louis Latour,"There are dark tannins here, although they are embedded in the ripe black fruits. This wine is solid and firm, the acidity giving the essential freshness. The fruitiness and the plush texture are taking their time to show. Drink from 2020.",92,100.0
700,Louis Latour,"Foursquare, almost chunky, the tannins dominate black fruits, dark chocolate and spice flavors. There is considerable concentration here, along with initial high acidity. Straight from bottling, the fruit is subdued. The weight of the wine, though, confirms that this is going to be a powerhouse.",93,279.0
701,Louis Jadot,"Relatively light and fruity with tight tannins. The wine has fresh acidity that still dominates the texture. There is a delicious spicy element that edges around the tannic core. It seems firm, not yet ready to soften into middle age.",93,
702,Albert Bichot,"As so often results from this vineyard, this is a lovely wine, the fruit ripe and showing considerable sweetness as well as richness. The structure is soft, open and elegant, surrounding the core of sweet tannins. Not for long-term aging, but worth waiting 4–5 years.",93,
703,Siduri,"Crisp and vibrant, this is also rich and flashy. It has the essence of ripe, wild raspberries that are spiced and smoked up in oak, leaving you dazzled by its allure.",90,48.0
704,Williams Selyem,"Pours kind of pale and feels light in body in the mouth, with acidic flavors of cherry skins and anise. Nice for its clean silkiness, but there's not a whole lot going on in terms of complexity.",85,34.0
705,Williams Selyem,"A little spare in concentration, yet elegantly constructed, with vibrant acidity and some firm tannins framing pomegranate, sour-cherry candy, mushroom, baking spice and toast flavors.",89,69.0
706,Lynmar,"This is one of Lynmar's most expensive Chardonnays, of their six 2011s. It's also one of the most forward and oakiest. Your first impression is of sweet buttered toast, sprinkled with brown sugar and drizzled with melted butterscotch. Then the tropical fruits kick in, brightened with citrusy acids. It's an impressive feat, but the wine feels overworked, and lacks the sustaining interest of Lynmar's other bottlings.",88,70.0
707,Testarossa,"Earthy, like some Napa Chards, with a sage and thyme edge to the pear and peach fruit. The wine also is a little soft. But there's an interesting minerality. Could develop bottle complexity over the next few years.",87,39.0
708,Chehalem,"Just slightly off-dry, this excellent bottle mixes its ripe lemon, orange and papaya fruit with breakfast tea-like flavors. Its acidity is ample enough to keep the sweetness at bay, making it a fine, all-purpose wine that should please a wide variety of palates.",91,20.0
709,Albert Bichot,"Rich, deliciously fruity and ripe, this combines warmth with a more mineral undertow that cuts through the palate, creating a wine that is refreshing and mouth-filling. It would be worth aging for two years or more.",87,20.0
710,DFJ Vinhos,"This is a ripe, smooth blend of Alvarinho and Chardonnay. The two complement each other well with yellow fruits touched by a more citrus edge and a rich character. It is fruity, full-bodied and ready to drink.",88,10.0
711,DFJ Vinhos,"Named after the Portuguese word for the sommelier's tastevin, the wine is rich with juicy red fruits. It has a firm structure that emphasizes the wine's youth showing that it should develop. Densely textured at the end, the wine will be ready to drink from 2017.",88,15.0
712,Wines & Winemakers,"A big, ripe and spicy wine that is full of red fruit notes and gentle tannins. It is open and accessible, its fruit juiciness already a pleasure to taste. There is fresh acidity on the finish. Drink now through 2019.",90,15.0
713,Foxen,"This bottling by Foxen has been consistent over the years in producing a wine of great varietal purity. The 2012 vintage is a dry, crisply mouthwatering wine with gooseberry, grapefruit and peach flavors. Goat cheese comes to mind as the ideal pairing, perhaps in a salad of bitter greens and grapefruits.",90,28.0
714,Georges Duboeuf,"Big, bold and tannic, this is powerful Gamay from La Tour du Bief vineyard in Juliénas. It has weight, and a concentrated texture that bodes well for the wine's future. Along with this structure are the fragrant black and red currant fruits, already delicious to drink.",90,
715,Georges Duboeuf,"A rich Pouilly Fuissé, concentrating on ripe tropical fruits and a rounded structure. The wine has weight, richness and a good density. With all these complex characters, it's a wine that needs to age over at least three years.",90,
716,Kunde,"This is a nicely balanced wine from estate-grown vines, a mix of licorice and raspberry that offers luxurious mouthfeel and texture atop surprising acidity. A small amount of Viognier was used in fermentation to provide some additional lift and floral aromas, while a dustiness prevails on the finish.",90,25.0
717,Columbia Crest,"A scintillating scent of rose petals opens up this pleasing wine, which continues with raspberry and cherry fruit, accented with light milk chocolate. It is not a heavy wine; in fact, if Franc can ever be called elegant, even feminine, this is how it should taste. The finish falls off rather quickly, but otherwise it is a fine effort.",87,30.0
718,Fess Parker,"Deep but elegant lilac and rose petal aromas meet loamy soil, river stone and tangy cranberry on the nose of this bottling from this historic vineyard. There is great depth to its flavors—a layering of dark raspberry thyme, anise and dill—while showing plenty of turned earth notes throughout.",92,55.0
719,Casa Santos Lima,"This producer, based in the Lisboa region, has branched out into the Alentejo to source this rich, generously ripe wine. With its full-bodied plum and spice flavors, it is soft with a light touch of tannin. Drink now.",85,15.0
720,DFJ Vinhos,A light and fruity wine that is deliciously crisp with raspberry flavors and is nicely cut with acidity. Drink now.,85,10.0
721,Wines & Winemakers,"An attractive rosé, made from 100% Castelão, the local grape of Setúbal peninsula. It is crisp with citrus and ripe with raspberry giving a fine balance and refreshing character. Drink now.",85,13.0
722,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"This rich and structured wine is packed with both ripe black fruits and concentrated tannins. It is a big wine, a fine representation of this appellation with its dense flavors and aging potential. The wine should be ready from 2021.",90,
723,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"This ripe, wood-aged wine is generous and smooth. Spice and toastiness are balanced by the apricot and citrus fruits. One gives richness, the other crispness. It is a wine with a future. Drink from 2020.",90,56.0
724,Louis Latour,The wine has a good structure with sophisticated tannins and perfumed acidity. Black cherry and spice from the wood are balanced by the freshness of the acidity and the rounded aftertaste. Drink from 2019.,90,75.0
725,Robert Mondavi,"The cool vintage resulted in an unusually lean and streamlined, but by no means uninteresting, wine. It's subtly fruity with hints of citrus zest and grapefruit. The main note, however, is gooseberry—barely ripe, acidic, mouthwatering and white peppery. The finish is absolutely dry. It should develop earthy, dried fruit notes over the next six years.",92,40.0
726,Siduri,"Your classic Sonoma Coast flavors have a feral element, suggesting foresty mushrooms, pine cones and mineral things alongside the pomegranates and cranberries. That's just what you get in this bottling from Siduri. The chilly vintage has made it lighter and lower in alcohol than the rich 2007, but it's more elegance and complex. This is a very interesting wine, one to linger over as it breathes in the glass.",92,48.0
727,Williams Selyem,"Fairly tannic and very dry, with ripe, jammy flavors of cherries and raspberries that taste like they were baked into a pie sprinkled with cocoa and cinnamon, and then drizzled with anisette liqueur. Should develop additional bottle complexity over the next six years.",92,54.0
728,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"A structured, cool wine that is poised and elegant, it has a lightly creamy texture cut by apple and pear flavors. Definitely mineral, it is textured with fruit skins and flavored with the oak aging. It needs to be aged, so don't drink before 2016.",89,57.0
729,Louis Latour,This attractive village wine has ripe fruits as well as a more steely texture. Wood flavors give smoothness that rounds out the wine and enhances the yellow fruit flavors. Drink now.,89,80.0
730,Louis Jadot,"Jadot's take on Burgundy Chardonnay is fruity and creamy. Juicy, intense acidity comes from the crisp apple and white peach fruits. A touch of wood aging softens the fruit and broadens the character of the wine. Drink now.",86,18.0
731,Robert Mondavi,"Complex and grippy, it offers classic layers of spicy black pepper, clove and red cherry and plum fruit. Not overpowering on the palate or in price, it will pair with flair.",88,21.0
732,Concha y Toro,"True bargains are hard to come by, so drop your guard for this $8 SB and you may wind up happy. Xplorador from Concha Y Toro is peachy and simple, with light grassiness and green notes. But it does have a plump, neutral palate and likable pineapple and apple flavors. Inoffensive and not flashy, but good for the money.",84,8.0
733,Casa Santos Lima,"The wine is full of the warmth of the Alentejo sun. While it does have a crisp and juicy side, it is the richness and concentration that makes it attractive. Black fruits and toast from the oak aging are balanced and cut through with acidity. Drink now.",85,15.0
734,Wines & Winemakers,"The blend of Bical and Arinto is typical of the sparkling wines from the Bairrada region. Together they give a crisp style of wine, bright with acidity and tangy with citrus and orange peel. The wine is ready to drink.",85,16.0
735,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"Produced from old vines in the Aegerter Domaine, this wine is dominated by red fruits and spice from wood aging. It is fruity, perfumed and likely to be ready to drink soon. Drink from 2018.",85,28.0
736,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"Light and crisp, this wine has citrus and green-plum flavors. It is still developing, with plenty of acidity as well a perfumed character. Drink this attractive wine from 2018.",85,16.0
737,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"This blend of Gamay and Pinot Noir, mainly from Beaujolais, is fruity with soft cherry flavors. Its attractive fruitiness and balanced acidity are immediately accessible and ready to drink.",84,
738,Foxen,"Enormously rich, showing cola, black cherry pie filling and even some dark chocolate notes. There's a soft sweetness of fruit and oak that suggests drinking this lovely wine now. You can't go wrong with a grilled steak, or carne asada.",92,60.0
739,Foxen,"There's a severity of acids and tannins that limits this Pinot's immediate enjoyment. It feels tight and hard, despite a core of black and red cherries and the sweetness of toasty oak. All indications point to the cellar. Give it 6–7 years, and it could be going strong well after 2020.",92,60.0
740,Maryhill,"Baking spice, freshly hewn wood and dark fruit aromas are followed by pitch-black-fruit flavors. The volatiles are just in check.",87,40.0
741,Robert Mondavi,"This wine gets a bonus for venturing into new territory, aging Cab in used Bourbon barrels. The result is far from perfect, but not as gimmicky as one might assume. Aromas of leathery blackberry, cedar, roasted pasilla chile and tons of caramel lead into flavors of cocoa, coconut and caramel on the creamy, peppery palate.",87,14.0
742,Trapiche,"Citrusy aromas suggest white grapefruit. Plump but balanced in feel, this tastes a bit salty and briny, maybe a reflection of its partial coastal grapes, something that's new to Argentina. The briny tangy finish is interesting.",87,20.0
743,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"Vines in the hills west of Nuits Saint-Georges are the source for this crisp red-currant-flavored wine. It has a juicy character, bright with red fruits. The wine will be ready from 2018.",86,
744,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"Soft and fruity, this young wine is full of red fruits and attractive acidity. It has a core of tannins that will soften over the next few months. Drink from 2018.",86,
745,Testarossa,"This is a big wine that's not ready now—it's too tannic. That gives it a lockdown, numbing quality that blocks a full appreciation of the fruit. But what fruit! Blackberries pure and simple, reduced to their quintessence. Such is the inherent integrity of this wine that it should effortlessly negotiate 4 to 6 years, gradually softening.",91,54.0
746,Iron Horse,"You won't miss the presence of oak in this Chardonnay. It's brilliantly forward, ripe and savory, with orange, mango and lime flavors. Natural acidity and a creamy, leesy richness bring extra layers of appeal, and the finish is thoroughly dry.",92,27.0
747,Williams Selyem,"This shows the lovely balance of both the winery and the appellation, with a silky, lightly tannic mouthfeel brightened by plenty of acidity. The flavors are delicate and complex, suggesting wild raspberries, thyme, cranberries and toast. No reason to age this puppy, so drink now–2016.",91,52.0
748,Louis Latour,"The grandest of all white Burgundy vineyards, Montrachet has produced a powerful, great wine, with impressive ripe, dense fruit. There is still elegance, a sense of proportion, but the opulence of the Chardonnay here is impossible to resist.",95,440.0
749,Trapiche,"Spice and dusty fruit aromas are equalized by saucy, funky, leafy notes. This is full in the mouth, with flavors of brown sugar, baking spices and baked cherry. This finishes with mild spice and oak flavors.",84,10.0
750,Kendall-Jackson,"This substantive Pinot shows definite toasted oak character along with ripe fruit, full body and firm tannins. Hints of oak smoke and caramel waft over the ripe plum aromas. The flavors go to dark cherries and coffee, the texture is attractively astringent from tannins, and the finish carries a little bite. Well done but not overdone.",91,35.0
751,Georges Duboeuf,Intense fruit and acidity give this wine a brightly refreshing character. It's about lemon and lime flavors with slices of red apple to bring out more sweetness. The aftertaste has a mineral edge that will allow the wine to age. Drink from 2017.,89,25.0
752,Louis Jadot,"A wine that reveals a textured side of Meursault. It has weight, ripe apricot and pineapple fruit with a refreshing touch of acidity. But the chalky, mineral character equally defines the wine. Age for 3–4 years.",92,75.0
753,Georges Duboeuf,"From a 15-acre vineyard owned by Georges Duboeuf. It is a big, bold, ripe wine backed by light wood flavors, and juicy red plum fruits. It is vivid, colorful and solid.",90,
754,Williams Selyem,"This bottling has been remarkably consistent over the last several vintages. Always exotic in lemondrop-candy fruit that's been well-oaked, it has nuances of flower petals, white peaches, minerals and honey. The '06 may be a little softer than past vintages.",90,50.0
755,Lynmar,"This sugary-sweet dessert Chardonnay tries hard to please, offering waves of honey, tangerine, mango and vanilla flavors. It's tantalizingly delicious, but could be just a tad more concentrated, especially at this price.",88,50.0
756,Montes,"Montes' first Alpha Malbec is serious and healthy, with rubbery, leathery berry aromas and crusty, dark oak scents. This is full and fairly oaky on the tongue, with herbal black-fruit flavors, raw wood notes, espresso-like bitterness and heat on the finish.",88,25.0
757,Wines & Winemakers,"In the spirit that Tejo can grow anything on its fertile soil, this wine is a rounded tropical-fruit-flavored Sauvignon Blanc. It has acidity enough as well as a warm smooth character. It is certainly ready to drink.",86,23.0
758,Wines & Winemakers,"This is an unusual view of the red Castelão grape, here vinified as a white wine with no skin color at all. Some wood aging adds spice and roundness to what is a smooth, while toasty, wine. Its white fruit and acidity are joined by some tannins. So this wine needs a few more months. Drink from early 2018.",86,30.0
759,Wines & Winemakers,"This ripe perfumed wine is soft with attractive melon and kiwi fruit flavors. It is gently textured, spicy and with just enough acidity. There is a touch of pepper at the end.",85,14.0
760,Casa Santos Lima,This is a soft wine with attractive ripe strawberry fruits and a soft texture. There is balancing acidity giving an edge of freshness to the otherwise gentle fruity texture.,84,10.0
761,Georges Duboeuf,"Smooth and generous, this wine is soft and missing any bite. It is round and unfocused, but ready to drink now.",84,43.0
762,Robert Mondavi,"This is a straightforward, lush and alluringly tart white that offers an oaky backbone of vanilla wrapped in fresh layers of fig, apple and green olive flavor.",88,20.0
763,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Appealing aromas of cocoa, vanilla, spice and red fruit are followed by plump ripe fruit and barrel flavors. Chocolate flavors linger on the finish. The oak plays prominently.",88,15.0
764,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"The warmth of the vintage shows through on the fruit of this wine, which is chock-full of pineapple and other tropical aromas and flavors, sweetened by light barrel accents. It's a guaranteed crowd pleaser and a spot-on example of the variety.",88,11.0
765,Williams Selyem,"An interesting, crisp and bone-dry Chardonnay that succeeds in offering plenty of complexity despite the absence of any oak influence. The flavors carry the load, with intense notes of apricots, Meyer lemons and guavas, and a wonderful minerality—like a lick of cold steel.",91,37.0
766,Concha y Toro,"This ripe, dark Maipo Syrah opens with slightly generic aromas of blackberry and black cherry. Rich, resiny and creamy on the palate, this tastes oaky at first; next come roasted spicy blackberry flavors in front of a minty finish with wood-spice notes and barrel-related tannins. Drink through 2021.",91,125.0
767,Chehalem,"This is dry, crisp and nicely detailed, with a persistent, clean and fresh mouthfeel. Notes of cucumber, salad greens and citrus, notably lime and grapefruit, are underscored with appealing minerality. This remains one of the highlights of Chehalem's expansive portfolio.",90,24.0
768,Fess Parker,"From the family's westernmost vineyard, this bottling is fabulously complex. It shows dense dried fruit and turned earth aromas, along with chaparral, smoke, clove and nutmeg. Those wild elements figure strongly on the sip, which shows thyme, rosemary and sagebrush accents around a core of plum, pomegranate and hibiscus flavors. A vanilla flair graces the finish.",94,58.0
769,Siduri,"Released too young, at just over a year of age, this Pinot tastes sugary, with primary fruit essence, glycerine, alcohol and caramelized oak giving it an uncomfortable sweetness. It's probably technically dry, and should actually taste dry by 2011, but it's certainly not ready to drink before mid-2010.",88,50.0
770,Louis Jadot,"Better known for its red wines, Ladoix's whites are a rarity. This wine is made from fruit sourced from vines that are close to the Corton hill. It is steely, minerally and crisp, with a wood-influenced character. With its structure, this needs at least three years of aging.",89,45.0
771,Chehalem,"It clocks in at an astonishing 15% alcohol, but does not show it in terms of flavor. The fruit is plenty ripe and a bit thick, but well-supported with acidity. Nonetheless the wine seems heavy and monolithic, having lost some of the vivid freshness of the other Chehalem white wines from this vintage.",86,22.0
772,Concha y Toro,"From a warm year, this smells toasty and oaky more than anything. In the mouth, core acidity is driving and creates a sharp, racy feel, while woody flavors of tropical fruits and melon finish with oak-based cinnamon and spice as well as a resiny texture.",86,18.0
773,Concha y Toro,"From a hot year with an early harvest, this Sauvignon smells green and ashy, like asparagus mixed with green tobacco. In the mouth, spunky acidity suggests sharpness, while tangy flavors of nectarine and nettle finish with touches of bell pepper and tarragon.",86,18.0
774,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Heady scents of honeysuckle, acacia and yellow stone fruit lead the way on this radiant white. On the vibrant, elegantly structured palate, energizing mineral frames mature apple, white peach, fresh apricot and chopped mint. Hold for even more complexity. Drink through 2023.",94,60.0
775,Chanson Père et Fils,"This wine comes from a vineyard that is wholly owned by Chanson. It is juicy, ripe while having a great, straight line of acidity. The red-berry fruits are still developing and coming through the firm, smoky dark tannins. The wine, with its spicy aftertaste, will be ready to drink from 2020.",94,118.0
776,Albert Bichot,"This rich wine is dense with dark tannins and concentrated structure. The vineyard, with cool winds from the valley behind, gives wines that demand aging with their tannins and fragrant fruit. The aftertaste is full of promise. Drink after 2022.",94,130.0
777,Albert Bichot,"This is a rich, smoky and structured wine. Black fruit and dark tannins form a dense texture with touches of licorice, spice and dark concentration. The acidity hints at the vintage giving a touch of freshness and lift. Drink this powerful wine from 2024",94,195.0
778,Montes,"Punchy raspberry, plum and spice aromas are straight from central casting as far as Pinot goes. This feels medium to full, while spicy, lightly leafy plum flavors are a touch herbal. Round and generous on the finish, this closes with dry, spicy, herbal flavors and a solid oak component.",89,23.0
779,Undurraga,"This smells good and right, with aromas of tropical fruits, spice and mild oak. Fresh and integrated, with good body weight and balance, this Chardonnay tastes of spiced apple, melon and vanilla. On the finish, wood spice and peppery dryness take over.",89,18.0
780,Kunde,"There's a tough, gritty feeling in the mouth with this dry, tannic wine. Although it has some rich flavors blackberries and blueberries, it's astringent and hard. Give it a good long decant and drink now.",86,30.0
781,Louis Jadot,"A soft, yet also mineral-textured wine. Its lemon and grapefruit flavors are crisp, reflecting the taut structure of the vintage. A fresh wine, with a crisp finish, ready to drink.",86,14.0
782,Testarossa,"A slightly darker shade of yellow, this wine from a historic vineyard offers preserved lemon, toasted almond and a doughy character on the nose. It's very tactile on the palate, clinging to the tongue strongly, showing flavors of stone fruit, mandarin pith and underripe tangerine juice.",89,49.0
783,Concha y Toro,"Crisp citrusy aromas include notes of crushed vitamin and ocean breeze. This is tangy and speedy on the palate, with racy acidity. Tangerine and lime flavors are stony, while this is fresh, lasting and citrusy on the finish.",89,17.0
784,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"The nose is like pear juice spilled onto warm earth, while the palate is more citrus-focused. A seam of almost tropical acidity links lemon to notes of pineapple, lifted by joyful freshness.",90,30.0
785,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Jasmine, honeysuckle, apricot and citrus aromas open. The bright, savory palate presents juicy pineapple, ripe pear, white peach and lemon zest framed in tangy acidity. Hints of Mediterranean herb add depth while a mineral note energizes the finish.",90,17.0
786,Testarossa,"A brisk, bright Chardonnay, made in the Testarossa style of ripe fruit and oakiness. What it lacks in subtlety it makes up for in the sheer power of tangerine, pineapple and tropical fruit flavors, elaborated with vanilla cream and caramelized oak.",87,20.0
787,Columbia Crest,"Light and pleasant, with aromas mixing baked pears, citrus and honeycomb, this is really a lovely wine for the price. The fruit flavors follow consistently, pears and apples with a hint of citrus, clean and refreshing, with juicy acidity.",87,8.0
788,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"The intensity of this wine is extraordinary, with huge spice flavors and a richness that almost becomes sweetness. There is honey as well as ripe white fruits, the acidity just a glint in the aftertaste.",94,75.0
789,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"The Clos Windsbuhl produces an opulently rich and sweet wine, gorgeously ripe and packed with tropical fruits. It is dense and powerfully concentrated, intense and very ageworthy.",94,60.0
790,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,This intense wine has great ripe fruit and sweetness to go with the pear and honey flavors. There is great acidity and beautiful fruit character in a gorgeous wine that still keeps its style and freshness.,94,100.0
791,Iron Horse,"The inaugural offering of this block-designate is dark and brooding, with tightly constructed, sizable tannins and oak still pronounced on the palate. Time should develop its floral notes of rose and orange peel, with accents of tea, cranberry and pomegranate. Cellar through 2017.",90,85.0
792,Georges Duboeuf,"A fruity style, not powerful but bright, with some rich strawberry jam flavors. It has an edge of tannins as well as spice, dried fruits and a cool, soft aftertaste.",88,
793,Concha y Toro,"Nice aromas of cherry fruit and sweetness are perfectly clean, while the palate is slightly spunky and high in acid, with wild-berry flavors running side by side with red cherry and citrus. Has a tart, blazing side but also very good fruit character and purity",88,22.0
794,Georges Duboeuf,"A wine with some structure, firm tannins and attractive black cherry and spice flavors. The wine has good weight and a dense texture that promises medium-term aging.",88,
795,Wines & Winemakers,"From the northern part of Vinho Verde, this wine is produced from old vines that have been trained on traditional high trellises. It is full of citrus, ripe lemon and lime along with a crisp mineral texture. Its acidity is both tense and refreshing, allowing the wine a chance to age. Drink from 2018.",89,23.0
796,Trapiche,"Cola, blackberry and dusty aromas amount to something nice and inviting. Cab Franc is new to the Broquel lineup, and this is lush, bold and fruity in style, with blackberry, black cherry and mocha flavors in front of a toasty, full-throttle finish.",90,18.0
797,Gary Farrell,"Bright, beautiful and balanced, this tiny production wine is aflutter in high-toned citrus notes, melon and peach. A well-crafted marriage of power and sophistication, the aromatics of wild jasmine shine, while texturally the wine is round and softly layered.",93,60.0
798,Foxen,"A powerful, brooding nose of black cardamom and crushed clove melds with pomegranate and cherry, resulting in an incredibly aromatic wine that hails from a popular vineyard on the eastern edge of the appellation. The flavors are also quite deep—sour cherry, mocha, more clove—atop layers of bitter plum peels and refreshing acid.",93,48.0
799,Undurraga,"Composed, lightly woody aromas of berry fruits, spice and herbs are harmonious and earthy. This spunky Cabernet reflects a cool vintage via pepper, tomato, herb and berry flavors. A layered yet snappy finish shows good length and complexity.",90,25.0
800,V. Sattui,"This is a tight, extracted and focused wine generous in dark red fruit and forested earth. A thickness and density make it mouthfilling, juicy and most definitely full bodied. The finish is a mix of tobacco and black tea.",90,55.0
801,DFJ Vinhos,"Grand'Arte is the top range from DFJ Vinhos, highlighting wines that express the individual varieties. Labeled Shiraz rather than Syrah, this is a powerful, spicy, rich wine. Solid tannins and dark black fruits are layered with acidity and ripe plums. With its structure, it will age well for a value-priced wine; drink from 2017.",91,13.0
802,Bründlmayer,"With its balance of sweetness and acidity, this is a delicious wine that hints at honey as well as pear and ripe melon. There is a touch of wood in the background to give the wine further complexity.",92,
803,Robert Mondavi,"This Pinot's acidity, tannins and juvenile fruit suggest time in the cellar. It's rich in raspberries, plums and cherries, with the interesting note of sweet heirloom tomato you sometimes get from Carneros. The narrow window of drinkability is 2015–2017.",91,60.0
804,DFJ Vinhos,"This 50-50 blend of Pinot Noir and Touriga Nacional works surprisingly well. It has weight, but also a smooth texture and juicy swathes of black plum and red berry fruits. Juicy fruit flavors are encased in a firm, tannic shell that's solid and dark. The wine is drinkable now after decanting, but could benefit from aging until 2016.",91,18.0
805,Testarossa,"This is a softly delicious, immediately likeable Pinot. It's all about pie-filling raspberries and cherries and cola, with sweet toasted oak and fabulously exotic spices, leading to a dry finish. Defines in its own way coastal Pinot in its ripest, silkiest, drink-me-now incarnation.",91,59.0
806,Robert Mondavi,"A majority varietal, this widely distributed wine also contains Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot. Dense and flat on the palate, it dances in bay leaf and black cherry, finishing with more herb around a tight fist of ripeness.",86,55.0
807,Santa Ema,"Dark purple in color, with a creamy, candied, berry fruit nose that's potent but not very stirring. The palate shows concentration, but the flavors don't go beyond the basics: cassis, blackberry and a streak of sourness at the core. Also tannic and tough.",84,14.0
808,Wines & Winemakers,"A blend of Touriga Nacional and Alicante Bouschet with Syrah, this is a finely structured wine. It is spicy, packed with black-currant fruits and with ripe tannins. The fruits and the dusty texture are just coming together, although the wine will be better from 2017.",91,18.0
809,Testarossa,"This winery not only makes a bunch of single vineyard bottlings, but also tries to show off different styles. This one shows sweeter white peach, ripe cantaloupe, lush mango and a touch of vanilla on the nose. The palate is ripe and round with more mango, melon, papaya and banana flavors, yet that opulence is bound by chalky structure and lots of back-end acid.",91,48.0
810,Concha y Toro,"Usually Terrunyo exudes blatant ripeness, but this cool-vintage rendition smells stalky, rubbery and herbal more than ripe and lusty. The palate is chunky and extracted, but shallow. Herbal blackberry flavors are toasty and oaky, with licorice, pepper and spice flavors carrying a short finish.",89,40.0
811,Gary Farrell,"This low-production Pinot shows off the elegance and balance you expect from this famous vineyard. The wine is dry and tart in acidity, with drink-me-now cranberry, pomegranate, mushroom and new oak flavors. Decant it for an hour or two.",89,70.0
812,Maryhill,"Aged in 45% new French oak, aromas of cocoa, vanilla and barrel spice are at the fore followed by full-bodied but still tart raspberry and cranberry flavors. It brings a bit of heat along with it.",87,34.0
813,Maryhill,"Light in color, aromas of barrel spice, herb and red fruit rise up from the glass. The palate packs a mouthful of red-fruit flavors, with the tannins showing a bit of astringency.",87,26.0
814,Louis Latour,"This wine has structure and tannins. With ripe apples and quince flavors, it is tight, tense while also full in the mouth. A strong background of acidity gives concentration and considerable freshness at the end. Drink from 2017.",88,
815,Louis Latour,"This wine is soft and creamy with baked apple and pear flavors. A line of acidity gives freshness and a mineral edge, offering a texture that will allow the wine to age. Fruity and soft, it will be ready to drink from early 2016.",87,
816,Kunde,"Sugary orange-jam and vanilla flavors are brightened by crisp acidity that gives this wine a clean finish. Lightly-oaked, it's easy to drink on its own, or with appetizers such as tempura, bacon-wrapped shrimp or toast with goat cheese and roasted peppers.",88,22.0
817,Georges Duboeuf,"With ripe fruits and balanced tannins, this wine is developing well. It has generous berry flavors, ripe black currants and refreshing acidity. The tannins are still prominent and need to soften. Drink from late 2016.",89,19.0
818,Williams Selyem,"Perfumed and strikingly floral, this soft, seductive Pinot is light in color and body, with handsome layerings of strawberry fruit, Asian spice and suggestions of just-unearthed mushrooms or a newly minted Christmas wreath. On the finish, a touch of vanilla-tinged oak rounds things out.",94,75.0
819,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"The blend includes 18% Syrah, which helps to emphasize the spice and sweet fruit flavors. But in the back, this is a stiff and fairly tannic wine, with a disconnect between the strawberry fruit and the slightly stemmy, herbal finish.",85,18.0
820,Lynmar,"The vintage was kind to this bottling, resulting in fabulously ripe flavors of cherry, black raspberry and cola that finish in a swirl of exotic spices. It's a bit heavy and direct in primary fruit, but the acids and tannins are fine, and should allow this wine to age for the next 6–8 years.",92,70.0
821,Williams Selyem,"Dry and elegant, this Pinot has a Central Coast feeling, with a pale color and brisk acidity. The cherry, cola, spice and oak flavors seem a little simple now, but that could be deceiving, as years in the cellar might benefit.",87,49.0
822,Siduri,"Shows the crisp, silky elegance and spicy fruit that characterizes this red hot appellation. It's not the biggest Pinot around, nor is it ageworthy, but it's satisfying in cherry, cola, rhubarb and spice flavors, with an edge of tomato.",87,29.0
823,Kunde,"Tasty and easy to drink, this has blackberry, black currant and cola flavors that finish seemingly sweet and oaky. It's an intense wine that doesn't seem likely to make gains with age, so drink up after an hour or two in the decanter.",87,45.0
824,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Thanks to its large case production, this crisp Greco di Tufo should be easy to locate at your local wine store or supermarket. It offers a wonderful introduction to southern Italian, volcanic soil winemaking thanks to drying mineral tones, pear and apple.",88,20.0
825,Siduri,"Doesn't taste fully ripe, with a wintergreen, minty edge to the raspberries and cherries. Sugary sweet in the finish, too. Shows the difficulties of this extremely cool vintage.",85,30.0
826,Louis Latour,"Without big oak or big fruit to make it ungainly, this is a real food-friendly Chardonnay. The delicate floral aromas and understated yet finely etched pear and almond flavors almost seem designed to show off that special weekend dish you just spent hours making.",86,26.0
827,Louis Latour,"Smells like Pinot, with meaty plum and fleshy black cherry aromas. Tastes like Pinot, with a supple texture and cola and black cherry flavors. Why can't more wineries turn out good Pinot at this price?",86,12.0
828,Trapiche,"Cherry, plum, bacon and licorice are all good aromas that indicate that this value wine has quality backing it up. The palate is fresh and clean, with depth and ripe, slightly oaked flavors of cassis, blackberry and chocolate. Easy to like, with toasty touches throughout.",88,10.0
829,Maryhill,This pale pink colored wine offers appealing aromas of watermelon Jolly Rancher and cherry. It drinks off dry with mouthwatering cherry flavors.,86,18.0
830,Williams Selyem,"This wine from the personal vineyard of the winery's co-founder has assertive woodsmoke, toasted oak and forest aromas, its bright black cherry and pomegranate flavors accented by tamarind and black pepper. While strongly oaky and firmly tannic in texture, it has a sleek and nervy aspect that's very appealing.",92,82.0
831,Testarossa,"Ripe, savory cherry, cola and currant flavors mark this fresh young Pinot. They're brightened by crisp acidity that cuts right across the palate, making it juicy and clean. Elegant in mouthfeel, with earthy, mushroomy complexities, it should develop over the next six years.",92,59.0
832,Gary Farrell,"Offers tremendous pleasure now and over the next six years, in a wine that feels elegant and sophisticated. The tannin-acid balance is perfect, giving it a taut firmness, while the raspberry, cherry, plum and cassis flavors are elaborately rich, yet dry in the finish. The vineyard is in the Santa Rosa Plain, a cool area producing Pinots of elegance.",92,55.0
833,Testarossa,"This Pinot's immediate lusciousness belies its complexity. Your first impression is of ripe raspberries and cherries that taste like they were baked into a pie. Then layers of minerals, mushrooms, cola and earthier fruits like persimmons and rhubarbs appear, all made brisk by amazing acidity and finishing bone dry. Lovely now and over the next six years, after an hour or two in the decanter.",92,59.0
834,Robert Mondavi,"This bold red wine works its magic by offering hearty helpings of yeasty brioche, baked, stewed plum, black pepper and clove, remaining varietal and unabashed in its hold on the ripe vintage and sun-kissed appellation. Integrated, the tannin imprint is sizable, yet well managed.",90,23.0
835,V. Sattui,"This wine has gorgeous ripe fruit aromas, mouth-filling flavors and a plush, generous texture. A hint of smoke shades the ripe black-cherry aromas. Layered flavors of clove, cedar, pomegranate and rosemary intermingle on the palate. Despite the ripeness and full body, a fine coat of tannins and supportive acidity keep the mouthfeel fresh and appetizing.",92,45.0
836,Siduri,"With moderate alcohol and brisk acidity, this shows the elegance of the 2011 vintage, and it offers ripe flavors of cherries, cranberries and pomegranates. Drink now.",86,22.0
837,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Light plum and cherry flavors give a good first impression. The blend is not strictly traditional, with small doses of Syrah and Grenache in the mix. It fades quickly, and it shows some sourness on the finish.",86,16.0
838,Columbia Crest,"This Rhône-style white blend has a floral highlight that leads into tart white fruit, jicama, celery and melon flavors. A light grass-like note is also apparent, and the palate could use some more concentration.",86,20.0
839,Foxen,"Extremely light on the nose, this bottling from a dry-farmed vineyard (that's four years deep in a drought!) offers delicate lemon peel and riverstone aromas. Light lemon curd and nectarine flavors play into a palate that's more focused on grippy texture, with some rain-on-slate minerality providing backbone.",91,37.0
840,Montes,"Nice and welcoming on the nose, with melon, citrus and other punchbowl aromas. The palate is graced with fine acidity, which amplifies the wine's standard green apple and lime flavors. Clean and showing no glaring issues. Textbook everyday Chilean SB; we could drink this stuff forever.",87,12.0
841,V. Sattui,"A fine Sauvignon Blanc, ripe, dry and pure in pineapple, lime green apple and oak flavors. Feels a little sweet and simple in the finish, but a fancy, crisp wine.",87,24.0
842,Louis Latour,"Open and inviting, this wine lays out traditional Chardonnay aromas and flavors of peach and citrus accented by toasty oak in a powerful and easily understood wine. There's a certain lack of finesse that's more than made up for by rich and expressive flavors.",88,44.0
843,Louis Latour,"This wine sees only 10–15% new oak, which allows the gritty peach and tangerine fruit flavors to shine through, dressed up by hints of toasted hazelnuts. White peaches and a powdered talc texture give the impression of richness without excess weight. Finishes long, with notes of mineral and citrus.",88,42.0
844,DFJ Vinhos,"The Estremadura region, north of Lisbon, is at the western extremity of mainland Europe. It produces a good line in this style of fresh, crisp wines, light and bright. There is just a hint of sweetness, with currant flavors and a final softness.",85,9.0
845,Wines & Winemakers,"Soft, smooth and fruity, this polished wine is full of red berry fruits and a touch of licorice. The juicy, ripe, immediately attractive aftertaste comes from the local Castelão grapes in the blend. Drink now.",85,11.0
846,Foxen,"Fresh raspberry and Bing cherry juice meet with wet black slate, rain on cement and toasted sagebrush scents on the nose of this block-selection expression. The palate opens with ripe red berry, then tightens on slightly sour cranberries, with singing acidity down the middle and a warmer anise tinge to the edges.",93,58.0
847,Gary Farrell,"This floral wine opens as if in a damp but not wet forest, surrounded by ripe, red cherry trees. Likable from the start, it's grippy on the palate, expressively juicy, seductive and refined. Blackberry and dried herb pop on the finish, providing a darker side to the red fruit.",93,55.0
848,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"Honeyed notes of pear promise oriental richness. The palate cuts this opulence, edged with Seville orange spice and a streak of zesty lime. This interplay between baroque and discipline continues, creating a scintillating experience. Enjoy the ride and marvel at all the spicy overtones.",93,60.0
849,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"The restrained and floral opening of jasmine and mandarin peel leads to a palate that holds just a touch of residual sugar, filling this gorgeously balanced Gewurztraminer to the brim with sweet citrus swirls of tangerine, satsuma and mandarin. Notes of orange blossom hover and are pulled into focus by the textured mouthfeel of this immensely elegant wine.",93,55.0
850,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"Very ripe, red-cheeked Mirabelles and orange peel represent the aromatic top notes. With more air, mandarin juice becomes apparent, and the palate is wonderfully taut and concentrated. There is a haunting purity and a strong undertow of earth and stone that soars on the long finish.",93,55.0
851,Iron Horse,"Formidable acidity gives this lovely wine a freshness around complementary layers of rose petal and strawberry-pomegranate. Made from a blend of two Chardonnay clones, it adds additional notes of tangerine and lemon-lime on the lengthy, complex finish.",93,50.0
852,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"Big, firm and dense, this is a powerful wine, with dark tannins that give a dry, concentrated character. The juicy plum and damson fruit flavors, along with the fresh aftertaste, will be a delicious balance as the wine develops. Drink from 2020.",93,260.0
853,DFJ Vinhos,"Pure Alicante Bouschet is rare in the cooler Lisboa region, but this wine certainly reveals much of the richness and intense fruit that makes this grape so popular among producers. It is a rich wine, with structure as well as fruit, that is ready to drink now.",90,15.0
854,Santa Ema,Resiny oak scents on top of standard apple and pear aromas describe the bouquet on this solid but woody Chardonnay. Oak-dominated flavors of pear and banana finish with medium acidity and lasting flavors of banana and wood resin.,85,15.0
855,DFJ Vinhos,"A blend of the rare Caladoc, a specialty of DFJ Vinhos, and Tinta Roriz, this is a soft, juicy, fruity and forward wine. It has bright red-berry fruit and light tannins, along with just a hint of wood aging. It's very ready to drink. Screwcap.",85,9.0
856,Georges Duboeuf,"This is soft and ripe, with red cherry and strawberry notes. It has a light tannic texture, with acidity and a broad, rich finish.",87,
857,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"The Horse Heaven Vineyard adds a welcome touch of minerality to the plain apple fruit flavor of the wine. It is this minerality that elevates it a notch, giving it a textural and refreshing mouthfeel.",87,15.0
858,Iron Horse,"This complex, tightly wound effort from a four-acre block planted to a single clone tastes of luxurious caramel and toasted oak, its flavors superimposed over a backdrop of forest-like scents.",90,85.0
859,Wines & Winemakers,"Properly almost black in color (as befits a wine from the red-juiced Alicante Bouschet), this wine reveals an impressive depth of flavor. It is dark and concentrated, powered by still-young tannins. There is an unfortunate edge of extraction that takes away from the ripe black-plum fruit and the acidity. It will be ready from 2019.",90,77.0
860,Testarossa,"This is a big, kick-butt wine that shows the powerful fruit and hard tannins that make Pinots from this vineyard ageable. You'll find it tough and gritty now, with rich, deep flavors of cherries, currants, cola and cedar. Best beyond 2011.",93,56.0
861,Montes,"Montes Folly is the benchmark by which all other Chilean Syrahs must measure themselves. Yes, it's entirely New World in its approach, but how can you gripe about such a potent brew of balsam wood, tanned leather, licorice, mineral and monster black fruit? The palate is big but balanced by live-wire acidity, and even at 15% alcohol it's harmonious. A real winner; one of the best Folly wines to date.",93,95.0
862,Kendall-Jackson,"Shows the soft tannins and slight herbal quality of a top Alexander Valley Cab, along with low-yield mountain concentration of red and black currants, mocha and spice. Drink this polished, supple wine through 2012.",92,60.0
863,Concha y Toro,"Toasty oak, wood smoke and baked white-fruit aromas carry the nose. Juicy, cidery acidity bolsters flavors of hickory and bitter peach pit, while apple and woodspice flavors dominate the finish on what amounts to a woody but tangy wine.",88,50.0
864,Georges Duboeuf,"This ripe wine has a full-bodied character that is then cut with acidity. It's juicy and fruity, with a good depth of flavor. The texture is firm, still young and needing until 2015 to age.",88,14.0
865,Georges Duboeuf,"Ripe cherries dominate this rounded, full-in-the-mouth wine. An attractive smoky character enhances the red fruits and balanced acidity. The wine is developing, still young and fruity and bright with freshness at the end.",88,14.0
866,Georges Duboeuf,"With rich fruits, this is a ripe and full-bodied wine. With ease and concentration, it handles considerable youthful acidity plus berry fruits and structure. It should be fully integrated by the beginning of 2015.",88,13.0
867,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"The aromas of coffee, red currant and red plum are bright and effusive, with tar and cough medicine notes in the background. The cherry flavors are plush and full, with coffee notes lingering on the finish.",88,24.0
868,Maryhill,"Aromas of green wood, herb and blackberry lead to full-bodied fruit flavors that provide appeal. The tannins bring some astringency.",88,45.0
869,Williams Selyem,"Very dry, tart and silky, this is a great Williams Selyem Pinot to drink now. It shows the classic elegance of the appellation, with nuanced flavors of raspberries, cherries, red currants, cloves, anise and pepper.",88,45.0
870,Casa Santos Lima,"This is a rich, wood-aged wine with spice, apricot and ripe plum fruits and a mineral texture. It is rounded as well as fresh, crisp with acidity while full in fruits. Drink this delicious wine now.",87,13.0
871,Siduri,"Shows fine Siduri character, a silky, dry wine with pleasant Pinot Noir flavors of cherries, currants, mocha and cola. Doesn't have the weight or density of the winery's single-vineyard wines, but the price is right.",87,20.0
872,Louis Jadot,"At this stage, the wine is all dark structure and very firm. It will need time to develop its full potential as an intensely rich wine. Concentrated and firm, it is powered by tannins as well as sweet red fruits. So age for five years at least.",94,85.0
873,Williams Selyem,"The color of this wine is deep, with a bright ruby rim. Effusive and enticing aromas of spicy cinnamon, toasted oak and red cherry notes meld into black cherry and pomegranate flavors. The balance is just right, the texture is snappy, appetizing and rich at the same time and the finish lingers. Best after 2016.",94,78.0
874,V. Sattui,"Reduced and extracted, this old-vine wine is smooth and velvety, powerfully made to reflect rich, ripe red berry and a layering of brown sugar. The finish is lean and reminiscent of black licorice.",90,47.0
875,DFJ Vinhos,"A fine and rich blend of Chardonnay and Arinto, this wine has touches of spice and vanilla as well as crisp, bright fruit tones. Citrus and yellow fruit flavors show strongly through the lacy texture of this wine, which has a cool character from the proximity of the vines to the ocean. Drink now.",90,15.0
876,Casa Santos Lima,"A wine from the Santos Lima home estate, the wine brings together two noble varieties in a homogenous, smooth blend. The tannins that are part of the DNA of both grapes have been softened by wood aging so that the dominant character of this ripe wine is almost refreshing, juicy acidity. Drink now.",90,26.0
877,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"This Merlot requires some extended breathing time before opening up. The fruit sources include Cold Creek, Canoe Ridge and the Wahluke Slope, bringing lush cherry/berry fruit to the fore, ripened to a level just below jammy. The tannins carry a hint of green, turning a little rough in the finish.",88,31.0
878,Louis Latour,The wine is dense with fine concentration and a solid dry tannin character at the back. It is full of black fruits and balanced acidity. Its richness reflects the quality of the vintage and its aging potential. Drink from 2022.,92,80.0
879,Concha y Toro,"Earthy aromas of crushed rocks and sea shells are backed by scents of garrigue and herbal black plum. This wine feels both lush and racy. Spicy, peppery plum flavors run long on a finish that shows a toasty accent. Drink through 2021.",91,25.0
880,Georges Duboeuf,"Mango aromas bring out the tropical character of this superripe wine. It is soft and creamy, maybe too much so, since it lacks a crisper edge. It is ready to drink.",85,28.0
881,Testarossa,"From a cool appellation, a wine that smells bright and clean, like the scent you get when slicing into a fresh peach. There's also a lot of young, toasty oak riding on top of the fruit. Long in the mouth and in the finish, this delicious wine has crisp, supporting acids.",91,35.0
882,Maryhill,"Tart to the point of being flat-out sour, this might appeal to lovers of rhubarb pie. Rhubarb and sour plum flavors are matched with sharp acidity. The fruit seems underripe.",84,28.0
883,Maryhill,"There is very little to distinguish any of the 2010 Maryhill Cabernets from each other. This shows a dash of cassis, with a big streak of vanilla and just a hint of orange peel.",84,25.0
884,Concha y Toro,"Minerally citrus aromas are the greeting on this high-end, pure SB. Stony minerality and citric acidity make for a fresh, polished mouthfeel, while flavors of lime, passion fruit and grapefruit are focused and smooth, and not at all soft. When people talk about fine cool-climate Chilean SB, this is what they should be referencing.",91,30.0
885,Wines & Winemakers,"Still young, this wine brings out the ripe and creamy side of Alvarinho. Its citrus character is prominent along with a strong mineral texture. Weight from the skin contact during fermentation has produced a dense structure. Keep this wine until 2015.",91,22.0
886,Louis Jadot,"This premier cru, surrounded by grand cru vineyards, has produced a luscious, ripe wine. It's generous in both black fruit flavor and structure, showing great potential for aging. Drink from 2021.",93,166.0
887,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"A new addition to the popular Indian Wells line, this consists of 60% Merlot, 28% Syrah and splashes of five other grapes. The Merlot, not surprisingly, dominates. Pretty and round, it has a soft, almost pillowy texture, with an easy, accessible mouthfeel.",88,18.0
888,Columbia Crest,"A fine, vivid, crystal-clear Pinot Gris, this offers cool cucumber and melon flavors first and foremost. It's a refreshing addition to the white wine lineup at H3.",88,15.0
889,Columbia Crest,"A fine bottle at a great price, this fresh and clean-tasting Sauvignon Blanc offers a bracing mix of tree fruit, with just a touch of sweet herb. It's clearly varietal: no frills, just straightforward and very nicely made.",88,8.0
890,Georges Duboeuf,"This is a firmly structured wine, but its black cherry flavor is marred by banana sweetness. Otherwise the wine is solid and tannic, with light acidity on the finish. Age for a year.",88,
891,Georges Duboeuf,"This taut, structured wine achieves a balance between red berry flavors and dry, firm tannins. It has a herbal edge and a solid, dense texture. It powers through with intense acidity on the finish.",88,
892,Foxen,"Billy Wathen and Dick Dore pick this cofermented blend of 85% Syrah and 15% Viognier together on the same day. The result is very savory, with resinous herbs and root beer on the nose. Once sipped, a rainbow of dark flavors emerges: chopped Italian herbs, creosote, black olive, fennel, soy and orange pith, reminiscent of a North African tagine.",92,44.0
893,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Cabernet Sauvignon (65%) takes the lead in this wine, followed by Merlot (29%), Malbec (3%) and Cabernet Franc (3%). Aromas of cocoa, vanilla, graphite, and red and black fruit are followed by palate-coating fruit and barrel flavors backed by firm but well-integrated tannins.",91,65.0
894,DFJ Vinhos,"Perfumed, with a soft, smooth texture, this has flavors of tropical fruit, peach and a hint of lemongrass that make for a rich wine.",86,8.0
895,DFJ Vinhos,"Smooth and oily in texture, this is round and full of pear juice flavor. There is just a touch of green legume, adding piquancy to this ripe wine. Screwcap.",86,8.0
896,DFJ Vinhos,"Ripe red fruits dominate this warm, round wine. The light touch of acidity makes the fruit seem forward and bright, yet the core remains rich and smooth. Its soft tannins make this ready to drink now.",86,7.0
897,Albert Bichot,"A fruity wine, this has exuberant red-berry flavors that suggest this wine can be consumed now. Gentle tannins balance the fine acidity and rich, warm texture.",87,
898,Columbia Crest,The Cabernet Franc matches well with the Merlot in this blend. Dark fruits and polished tannins elevate this well-defined wine. It has no frills but plenty of flavor.,87,8.0
899,Columbia Crest,"This is just a bit on the sweet side, but there is plenty of acidity to be found. It's fruity, peachy, succulent and fresh.",87,8.0
900,Louis Jadot,"A spicy, full, fat wine, with a good citrus touch, this is made lively by the green fruit flavors, the edge of honey and the rounding toast.",89,
901,Siduri,"Cherries jump out at you, a dense compendium of fruit set against iron and earth. The wine is a bit austere, tight; it may need decanting. But it's got good concentration and spice, and flavor that keeps on running through a long finish.",89,39.0
902,Casa Santos Lima,"This is a ripe and warm wine, with generous fruits and a structure that is cushioned by the rich black and red fruit flavors. It has light hints of wood aging, shown in the notes of spice and vanilla that have smoothed the tannins and tamed the acidity. Drink this attractive wine from 2016.",88,15.0
903,Robert Mondavi,"This wine has a zesty, effervescent aspect that provides a sense of refreshment, built around subdued oak and ripe lemon and lime. Medium in weight and dry, it finishes with a flair of salty brine, like an olive martini.",88,20.0
904,Testarossa,"This is a breadwinner bottling for the otherwise high-end, single-vineyard specialists from Los Gatos. It's a solid deal, offering a tight, slightly sour nose of cranberry juice, graphite and violets. The palate clings to juicy cherries with a sage-like twist.",88,20.0
905,Kendall-Jackson,"Here's a good buy in a big, rich, decadently delicious Syrah. Soft and dry, with refined tannins, it offers flavors of currants, blackberries, cherries, chocolate, licorice, Dr. Pepper cola, black pepper and spices. Easy to like, yet complex.",90,25.0
906,Kendall-Jackson,"Very rich, ripe and dry, a Merlot with a drop of Cabernet that needs a year or two to resolve. It's fat and fleshy in cherries, violets, red currants and cola, with a dusting of cocoa, pepper and cinnamon. The tannins are ample, but very finely ground. Hold until 2011.",90,28.0
907,Kendall-Jackson,"Tasted just after bottling, the wine was a little bottle-shocked, but should be fine by Summer 2010. Rich and creamy, with complex tropical fruit, buttered toast, lemondrop candy and honeysuckle flavors. An amazing 111,000 cases were produced.",90,21.0
908,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Part of a Limited Release series, this supple, oaky Malbec includes Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. Made from Canoe Ridge Estate Vineyard fruit, this offers compelling blue- and black-fruit flavors that are wrapped in coffee and cream notes. It's a structured wine that can be cellared up to a decade.",90,25.0
909,Foxen,"Exceptionally rich, a Pinot Noir that tastes dramatic from the get go. It's full-bodied, dry and velvety, with complex flavors of berries, pomegranates, cherries, cola, currants, mushrooms and spices. The firm tannins and crisp acids suggest ageability over the next six years.",92,56.0
910,Foxen,"With 50% new oak aging, the wood stands out now, showing caramelized and buttered toast flavors. Under that is a dry, tannic wine, filled with raspberries, cherries and spicy pomegranates. Complex and pedigreed, it wants some time in the cellar. Better after 2014.",92,56.0
911,Albert Bichot,"Ripe and generous, this floral wine is dense with fruit as much as tannins. It is full of blackberry and plum flavors, ripe while also cut with acidity. The spice that comes from the wood aging shows well, adding a further element. Drink the wine from 2022.",94,355.0
912,Chanson Père et Fils,"Steely and tight, this is a mineral-driven wine. With its vibrant acidity and tense texture, it is a classic Chardonnay that will fill out slowly and evolve favorably with time. Beneath the tension and forward acidity is a rich wine, though it needs time to show it. Drink from 2020.",94,171.0
913,Albert Bichot,"This is a rich wine from several parcels of vines in the Clos de Vougeot. It has great intensity, powered both by tannins and by the dark black fruits. Serious and concentrated, the wine will age magnificently. Drink from 2024.",94,306.0
914,Albert Bichot,"One-quarter of the Clos des Maréchaudes is classified Grand Cru, as the soil and the slope change. This shows in the power of the wine with its smoky tannins and dark character. Black fruits and a dense texture signify a wine with power and longevity. Drink from 2022.",94,150.0
915,Montes,"Blackberry and cola aromas are cool and collected. The palate has weight and texture to accompany berry, mint, herb and peppery flavors. Turns more herbal and roasted as it unwinds. Pepper and spice lead the finish.",88,24.0
916,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"Dry Riesling from vineyards in Turckheim. It has a great steely core, and layers of perfume and intense acidity. It is crisp, concentrated while remaining poised and elegant.",88,
917,Undurraga,"Balanced aromas of green herbs and citrus zest are fresh and vital but not aggressive. A lemony twinge of acidity lends snap to the palate, while this tastes of pithy briny tangerine and other citrus fruits. Flavors of salt, lime and grapefruit share the finish. Drink now.",87,12.0
918,Siduri,"From a site on the edges of Santa Rosa, this vineyard-designate shows a wealth of baked strawberry and is noteworthy for its vibrantly fruity aromatics. Ripe, velvety and lush on the palate, it delivers sensually and deliciously, with a lasting imprint of cola spice on the finish.",93,52.0
919,Lynmar,"This is a robust, full-bodied wine, balanced and complex, with a lush, plush mouthfeel that's seductive and velvety. Black pepper, clove and characteristics of earthy forest floor define it most, while dark cherry nips at its sides.",93,65.0
920,Testarossa,"Red cherry, root beer, a touch of sage and bay leaf and an shiitake-powered umami sensation decorate the nose on this wine from one of many single-vineyard expressions in this producer's portfolio. The palate shows cooked cherries and cranberries that float across a Mediterranean elements of olive, fig balsamic and menthol.",92,64.0
921,Maryhill,The aromas are quite subdued with notes of herbs and red fruit. The flavors are more generous but still come off as quite light.,86,24.0
922,Siduri,"Flashy, jammy raspberry and cherry fruit marks this vibrant Pinot Noir. It's just yummy, and made bright and clean with zingy acidity. Seems best now for its sheer youthful razzle dazzle, so drink up.",89,48.0
923,Lynmar,"Grown in the very cool central-southwestern part of the appellation, by Sebastopol, this Pinot features crisp, mouthwatering acidity. And, in this wonderfully long hangtime vintage, its flavors are extraordinarily rich and pure, brimming with cherries and raspberries. It shows layers of complexity, yet is too young, with the parts unintegrated. Give it 4–5 years in a cool cellar.",93,70.0
924,Chanson Père et Fils,"With its sweet wood, dense fruit and jammy character, this is a rich wine. It has some solid tannins, but they are almost lost in the welter of soft strawberry, nutmeg and juicy red berries. Typically with 2005, this is a wine whose opulence appeals now, but those tannins do suggest some good aging.",91,145.0
925,Chanson Père et Fils,"Light in color, this rejoices in its perfumed character as much as its fruit. There is a heady smoky aroma, while the palate shows a leaner character. The fruit flavors of red berries are given an extra dimension by the smoky wood and the meaty edge.",91,90.0
926,Montes,"Aromas of cocoa, cassis and marshmallow are sweet and attractive, while the palate feels just right and tastes of cassis, plum, caramel and pepper. While it is powerful, it's not a runaway tank. Thus expect a sly finish that's toasty, dark and polite. Drink now and over the next couple of years. Very good Cab from one of Chile's top producers.",91,28.0
927,Albert Bichot,"The instant appeal of seductive Pinot Noir is here, with its ripe fruits that are poised between sweetness and a pure line of acidity. The fruit is juicy, but always fresh, with wild strawberry flavors and just some spice from wood.",91,
928,Albert Bichot,"Exhibiting all the ripeness and richness of an Aloxe-Corton, this wine revels in delicious raspberry fruits, topped with red currant acidity. The wine rolls around the mouth, with a velvet texture on top of some firm tannins. There is a complex sweet and sour aftertaste, as the ripe fruit combines with fresh acidity.",90,
929,Chanson Père et Fils,"Soft, sensuous, this is a wine that appeals straight away to the senses. The red fruits float over a soft texture of sweet tannins, leaving a juicy, succulent texture. While it is not a powerful wine, it offers all the delicious characters of Pinot Noir.",90,80.0
930,Columbia Crest,"The aromas of dark coffee, bittersweet chocolate, vanilla, and black cherry are still locked up but provide appeal. The flavors are textured and full, showing layers of dark fruit that undulate into the distance and display a fine sense of balance.",92,45.0
931,Iron Horse,"This is an incredibly beautiful and yes, joyful, sparkler, made from equal parts Chardonnay and Pinot Noir. This particular offering was disgorged in July 2016. It positively impresses in minerality, complemented by a more fulsome sense of lemon, apple and hazelnut on the creamy palate, leaving a rich trail of silk on the finish.",98,250.0
932,Iron Horse,"An offering meant to toast all manner of celebrations, this wine wows, blending 78% Pinot Noir with 22% Chardonnay in a near-perfect union. Dry and beautifully floral, it opens in a bouquet of marzipan, peach and honey. The mousse is fine, while supporting acidity lends a lemon peel and grapefruit lift. The memory imprinted on the palate will linger long after all the toasts to the happy couple—or whatever else you're celebrating—have been made.",96,44.0
933,Lynmar,"The new oak is dialed down a bit to 33% in this memorable red from the producer's estate Quail Hill Vineyard. Lovely in every way, it opens in rose petals and a subtlety of Asian five-spice, before a succulence of cranberry, rhubarb and orange unleash a fullness of fruit and lush texture on the palate.",95,70.0
934,Williams Selyem,"Allen Vineyard grapes have the maturity and complexity to impart a boldly balanced roundness of lemon curd, fig and apple, plus a searing undercurrent of salty minerality. With substantial weight, and texture for miles, it remains bright and fresh in the glass, with a lingering impression of cinnamon toast.",95,58.0
935,Bründlmayer,"The merest hint of reduction reminds you of how young this wine actually is. On the palate, a very generous full-fruited picture unfolds: there is very ripe juicy yellow pear and countless juicy citrus notions of clementine, tangerine, satsuma and orange. All of this is cut with precise, tart and ripe lemon freshness. This interplay of tart and ripe creates tension and drive. This is lovely now but is a powerhouse of potent long-lasting fruit. Drink 2017–2040.",95,70.0
936,Bründlmayer,"Delicious notions of ripe greengages haunt the nose, alongside fragrant orange peel. The palate is still taut and tight, sprightly and streamlined, as if powered and propelled forward by invisible citrus force. There is such drive and precision here, you almost feel movement and speed. The finish is clean but clearly this is for the longer run. It will take bottle age for this to reveal its scented, fruit-laden core. Drink 2022–2040.",95,55.0
937,Kendall-Jackson,"A harsh wine, with cutting acids and a thin flavor of raspberry candy.",82,17.0
938,Undurraga,"Leafy, dry, earthy aromas come in front of a bouncy, fresh palate. Plum, cherry and pomegranate flavors drive this in the direction of red fruits, while the finish is a little woody, dry and peppery.",87,13.0
939,Columbia Crest,"The Cabernet in this blend is Cabernet Franc, making it a Right Bank Bordeaux-style blend, at an astonishingly low price. Tart berry fruit and some stiff tannins suggest that a bit more bottle age may help to soften it; there are already some pleasing suggestions of barrel toast that run through the aromas and on into the finish.",87,8.0
940,Concha y Toro,"Pure purple in color, this is a chunky, extracted blend of Syrah and Cabernet with plum and berry aromas along with hints of mint and olive. A full, tannic, somewhat raw palate houses earthy flavors of molasses and herbal black fruits, while the finish is heady and a touch green.",87,14.0

943,Louis Jadot,"This vineyard is widely regarded for its quality worthy of grand cru status, and this wine, from vines owned by Louis Jadot, is a fine example. It is both structured and richly fruity—dense with ripe red fruit flavors cut with acidity. A dry core of tannins will allow this impressive wine to age. Drink from 2024.",94,206.0
944,Maryhill,"If you are a fan of Rosenblum Zins, you might want to try this Washington Zin, styled in the same 16.4% alcohol mode. It's got plenty of syrupy berry fruit, and some very chocolaty streaks as well, but the tannins are earthy and still have a bitter finish to them. The winery's regular Zin is far better.",84,38.0
945,Santa Ema,"Slightly funky and pickled, but also dusty and endowed with raspberry and plum aromas. The palate rests on tangy rhubarb and nectarine, while the bouncy mouthfeel has spritz and kick. If not for the pickled rhubarb character, it would be more strongly recommended.",84,12.0
946,Testarossa,"Iron, pomegranate and dust aromas show on the nose of this entry-level bottling from the Los Gatos producer. Bright red fruits and solid brown spice show on the palate that proves light, airy and easy as it dances across the tongue with energy.",87,27.0
947,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"This wine is soft, with a light fruitiness and earthy flavors typical of some Pinot Noir. The tannic element gives a dry core to this simple, fruity wine. Drink now.",83,28.0
948,Undurraga,"Attractive aromas of floral berry fruits and sandalwood set up a pointy, fresh, clipped palate with raw acidity. Spicy plum and currant flavors finish dry and raw, with hard leftover tannins. Drink this staunch Cabernet from 2019–2025.",90,30.0
949,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"This rich and structured wine is packed with both ripe black fruits and concentrated tannins. It is a big wine, a fine representation of this appellation with its dense flavors and aging potential. The wine should be ready from 2021.",90,
950,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"This ripe, wood-aged wine is generous and smooth. Spice and toastiness are balanced by the apricot and citrus fruits. One gives richness, the other crispness. It is a wine with a future. Drink from 2020.",90,56.0
951,Louis Latour,The wine has a good structure with sophisticated tannins and perfumed acidity. Black cherry and spice from the wood are balanced by the freshness of the acidity and the rounded aftertaste. Drink from 2019.,90,75.0
952,Trapiche,"A little bit hickory-dominated on the bouquet, but also giving balsamic notes, blackberry and chocolate mint. The palate is linear due to a streak of cutting acidity, while the palate is also snappy with wild raspberry and bright plum flavors and plenty of wood tannin. A toasty finish with espresso and chocolate is fine and long. Drink now through 2017.",92,55.0
953,Williams Selyem,"A rich, spicy wine, marked by cinnamon and clove-accented raspberries, cherries, cola and mushrooms, as well as a bit of funk. Lovely and complex, it's a blend of various vineyards whose fruit Williams Selyem sources in the northwestern Russian River Valley. Now–2015.",92,69.0
954,DFJ Vinhos,"Want dense tannins? Then this your wine. Of course, it has much more than that. It has mineral-driven stone fruit flavors, a sense of terroir, of restrained power. It also has a serious side, and definite aging potential.",92,18.0

956,Siduri,"This succulent wine's brawny earth is steadied by fresh acidity, adding tart flavors of tangy rhubarb, cranberry and rose. Crushed rock and dried herb notes add savory complexity and texture, but it's the pretty aromas that ultimately seize the day.",93,55.0
957,Fess Parker,"This is a dark and tarry wine, perhaps a tad early for release, showing condensed purple flowers, beef jerky, charcoal and plum peels on the nose. The palate is tart and chewy, with asphalt, sour black fruit and tobacco notes. Wait a year and this may sing much more strongly.",86,35.0
958,Kunde,"Sharp acidity leads to defined flavors of green apple and lemon, maybe even as tart as grapefruit, within this medium-bodied wine with a richness of texture.",86,25.0
959,Bründlmayer,"Faint red apple and lemon scents show on the nose of this wine. Its soft, easy palate, enlivened with slight spritz, shows the same appetizing, freshly-cut red apple fruit. Light-bodied, charming, easy and fresh.",89,21.0
960,Bründlmayer,"Appetizing and fruity peardrop notes dominate the nose. The palate has a refreshing touch of green apple and light, easy fruitiness within a slender and dry frame. Lovely zestiness marks the finish.",89,22.0
961,Louis Jadot,"This is a major wine from a great white wine vintage that's naturally impressive and intense. Ripe white and yellow fruit dominates the palate, sustained by wood aging flavors and tight, nervy texture. Bâtard-Montrachet is largest of the five white Grand Crus in Puligny and Chassagne Montrachet. Drink from 2024.",98,367.0
962,Louis Jadot,"This is a powerhouse of a wine—structured and dense yet still developing and closed at this young stage. There's already a sense of both fruit richness and mineral texture, underpinned by oak spice, yet it will grow more powerful with time. Drink from 2023.",97,184.0
963,Louis Jadot,"The largest of the four grands crus in Morey-Saint-Denis, this vineyard gives the most structured wines. This bottling, with its tannins and power, is no exception.

965,Louis Jadot,"From one of the larger of the great grands crus of Vosne-Romanée and Flagey-Echézeaux, this is a dark, structured wine.

969,Foxen,"Quite dark and viscous in the glass, this bottling shows very concentrated, deep and intense aromas of black currant, charred rosemary, roasted meat and a hint of incense. There's a coffee and chai spice component to the sip alongside the persistent dark fruit, charcoal, black pepper and uplifting flavors of violet and lilac. Strong tannins ensure a long lie. Drink now through 2030.",94,48.0
970,Iron Horse,"Exuberant in mousse, this wine is luxurious and rich, the perfect quaff for any occasion. Made from 75% Pinot Noir and 25% Chardonnay, and aged for three years, it's bright in bolts of green apple and strawberry.",94,44.0

980,Concha y Toro,"Toast, coconut and pineapple all work the bouquet. It's zesty and healthy on the palate, with pear, coconut and baked apple flavors.

981,Gary Farrell,"This wine delivers in flavor and aroma, a refined layering of cherry and strawberry that celebrates what this aromatic clone can do in Russian River Valley. Orange peel and tart, tight acidity combine around a silky texture, with a ginger-spice finish and lingering hint of rose petal.",94,65.0
982,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Made from equal parts Greco and Fiano, Campanaro is Feudi's flagship white wine and exhibits fleshy tones of mature peach, honey and pear. Thanks to its crisp acidity, it would make an idea companion to cheesy pasta dishes. A wonderful wine overall.",91,48.0
983,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Pietracalda (“hot stone”) is Fiano di Avellino done in a vibrant and lively style to enhance its natural aromas of pear, peach and white stone. The wine has crisp acidity and a creamy, pulpy feel in the mouth.",90,33.0
984,Foxen,"Tasted in May, this Grenache-based Rhône blend was still overwhelmingly vibrant and fresh in grapey, primary fruit raspberry, cherry and blackberry flavors. It's appealing, but really needs some time to settle down and mellow, so the fruit and oak can mesh together. By the summer of 2009, it should be a wonderful wine, retaining its balanced lushness through at least 2012.",92,35.0
985,Maryhill,"Bone dry, earthy and leathery, this Proprietor's Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon seems a bit tired. The fruit is showing early signs of fading, and the tannins—earthy, green and a bit rough—may already be taking over. Some earthy, organic, almost biodynamic flavors come out in the finish.",85,36.0
986,Columbia Crest,"Occupying the bottom rung (in terms of cost) of the Columbia Crest ladder, Two Vines wines are generally light, quite clean and simple, with a minimum exposure to oak. This fits the mold, with flavors of strawberry chews and cotton candy. The tannins are also light and herbal, with an earthy, pleasantly leafy finish.",85,8.0
987,Gary Farrell,"This wine needs some coaxing at first to come out of its shell. Once settled, it entices in warming cardamom, clove and damp earth, taking on savory airs. Exuberant as it develops, it offers high-toned cherry and tangerine that surround a silky, subtle body. Hints of spicy cinnamon and white pepper mark the finish.",93,70.0
988,Trapiche,"Trapiche may be on to something with this Atlantic Coast Pinot Noir. Earthy aromas suggest bacon, tire rubber and oak-infused berry and cherry. The mouthfeel is fresh but weighty. Flavors of roasted cherry and plum are earthy, while this inaugural Pinot from south of Buenos Aires tastes meaty and feels warm on the finish.",89,20.0
989,Concha y Toro,"Perfectly good for the price, with a dark, smoky outlook and masculine aromas of mocha, roasted berry and violet. Like you'd expect for New World Syrah, it's intense but not aggressive, and the mix of plum, berry, cocoa and toast flavors give it amplitude and attitude. Well-made for a large-production wine (140,000 cases).",88,12.0
990,Undurraga,"Melon and green apple aromas are solid and clean. The melony palate offers a plump feel and bright, sweet flavors of mango, pineapple and apple. This wine delivers a lot of fruit and liveliness on a regular frame.",86,12.0
991,Louis Latour,"A warm, generous wine, full of ripe fruits. There is weight, richness and generosity here, although not a great depth of flavor.",86,45.0
992,Santa Ema,"Deep purple in color, spicy berry aromas open on the nose of this mint-laden Merlot. Lush, core flavors of blackberry and plum show a saucy green pepper quality on the finish.",85,10.0
993,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"A lightly pétillant ice wine. Harvested at almost 38 brix, it is not as dense and racy as the ice wines of British Columbia or eastern Canada, but it offers its own pleasures. Here are details of sweet straw, rice cracker, caramel and honey, nicely interwoven and persistent, and never turning cloying or sugary.",90,45.0
994,Concha y Toro,"Terrunyo is arguably Chile's best SB. This vintage gets going with a touch of green bean but also plenty of passion fruit and pink grapefruit. The palate is ripe, crystal-clear and tangy, and the passion fruit and citrus flavors really drive it home. Expect a racy wine with dynamic pineapple and grapefruit as its cornerstones.",90,29.0
995,Montes,"Minty, creamy and as oaky as can be. Coconut, sawdust, carob and other barrel-based aromas steal the nose, with secondary black fruit and thick tannins composing the palate. This is a ripped, high-alcohol, almost soupy Syrah that in some people's eye may seem overdone and too woody. But the fruit is of unquestionable high quality, and if you give it time to air out you'll get the best results.",90,82.0
996,Lynmar,"An enormously rich Pinot Nor, stunningly delicious. Hard to imagine a California Pinot offering more opulent notes at such a young age. Dazzles with raspberry and cherry pie filling, vanilla, toast and scads of spices, and feels so soft, so silky, yet finishes so dry. Really a stunner. Should glidepath through the next six years, gradually growing mushroomy.",96,70.0
997,Lynmar,"This single-vineyard Pinot Noir shows fine coastal acidity and dryness, and a transparency of taste that comes from the terroir. It's very delicious, with jammy raspberry and cherry fruit flavors enriched with oaky vanillins and smoky, buttery caramel. Gorgeous and compelling, combining power and nuance, it's a wine to drink now and through 2015, at least.",95,70.0
998,Williams Selyem,"A gigantic Chardonnay. What it lacks in subtlety it more than makes up for in sheer power. Dazzles with pineapple jam, mango, pear, lime, buttered toast and sweet oak flavors, balanced with fine acidity. There's a minerally stoniness that makes it even more complex. Drink now–2014.",94,50.0
999,Wines & Winemakers,"Part of a range of wines that showcases the different styles of Portugal's regions, This wine is smooth, creamily textured and with a warm ripe character. It has pineapple and mango as well as crisper lemon flavors to give a rich wine that is still poised and finely balanced. Drink now.",85,12.0
1000,DFJ Vinhos,"The wine, named after a typical mustache from the 19th century, is all fruit: ripe blackberries with balancing acidity. This is an easy ripe wine that will be great with barbecues this summer thanks to its soft tannins and drinkability.",85,9.0
1001,DFJ Vinhos,"A blend of Pinot Noir and Touriga Nacional, this is a smoothly ripe wine. Its cherry and spice flavors are given just a hint of structure built by a tannic edge. This soft juicy wine is ready to drink.",85,10.0
1002,Georges Duboeuf,"Vines over 50-years-old give a concentrated cru wine. It is ripe with berry fruits topped by spice. Fruity and likely to develop quickly, it is an attractive wine to drink young from mid-2017.",87,27.0
1003,Georges Duboeuf,"While it misses out on the firmer side of the Morgon cru, this is a robust ripe wine. It has attractive red-cherry fruit and juicy acidity. The structure will allow it to age for a few more months, so drink from late 2017.",87,20.0
1004,Georges Duboeuf,"A structured cru wine, full of firm tannins. It is a bold ripe wine with black-cherry fruit, a hint of banana and juicy acidity. The wine comes from a single 30-acre vineyard. Drink from late 2017.",87,20.0
1005,Concha y Toro,"Edgy aromas of citrus peel, green bean and green tobacco fail to register. The palate feels both flabby and high in acidity, as if it were worked on to not much avail. Tastes herbal and green, with a minty finish.",83,12.0
1006,Montes,"Roasted black olive and rubber aromas set up a tannic and heavy palate with a lot of oak but not much fruit to back it up. Tastes like cinnamon and spice, with middling blackberry and bitterness on the finish.",83,12.0
1007,Santa Ema,"The spectrum of varietal aromas is here: saline, olive, forest floor, tea and red and black fruits. Weighty and round in the mouth, with good feel and full blackberry flavors supported by creamy oak and vanilla. Juicy and red enough on the finish, where a pop of acidity registers.",87,12.0
1008,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Aromas of cedar, vanilla, raspberry, coffee, herbs and barrel spice are followed by concentrated fruit flavors backed by firm tannins. It's a delicious example of the variety.",90,30.0
1009,Iron Horse,"Copper-pink hues shade the experience of this vintage sparkling wine, a dry expression of a warm year. It's dotted in crisp, refreshing flavors of watermelon, grapefruit and lemon zest.",90,50.0
1010,Chanson Père et Fils,"This has ripe red fruits and soft, integrated tannins, with concentration and a voluptuous exterior. This will be ready to drink soon.",92,50.0
1011,Chanson Père et Fils,"Structured and fruity, this has plenty of minerality to pair with the crisp citrus flavor. The wood influence gives it extra depth, while the crispness is preserved by a final steely thrust. This structured wine should age for four years or more",92,53.0
1012,Louis Latour,"Solid and powerful, with a very firm character, this shows the structured, concentrated side of the vineyard, with complex acidity cutting through the dark tannins. The wine is condensed and solidly based around a firm, dry core.",92,260.0
1013,Albert Bichot,"Already dense, this wine seems to lack fruit. The tannins dominate at the moment along with acidity. It's likely to remain quite a tight.",85,23.0
1014,Georges Duboeuf,"Soft and fruity, it is already fully developed. Crisp apple flavors accompany bright acidity and a touch of minerality. Drink now.",85,27.0
1015,Georges Duboeuf,"Big and fruity, this wine is broad but without great definition. It offers weight, soft apple fruits and light acidity. Drink now.",85,19.0
1016,Concha y Toro,"Price aside, this is a fine, ready to drink, full-bodied Carmenère with earth, cola, tree bark, cherry and cassis aromas. It's full and a touch soft in the mouth, with easy tannins and bold flavors of blackberry, herbs, bitter chocolate and leather. On the finish, it's peppery tasting and mildly herbal. Drink now through 2016.",91,200.0
1017,Gary Farrell,"A very good wine from one of the newer entries to the Farrell pantheon of vineyard-designated Chardonnays. It's brisk in acidity, with voluptuous tropical fruit and green apple flavors. New oak brings the usual complexities of buttered toast and vanilla. The texture is just a little scoury. Drink now.",91,38.0
1018,Lynmar,"This is the most broadly appealing Chardonnay of Lynmar's wonderful 2011 offering. It makes all the right moves, with fine acidity and a hint of minerals giving structure to the tropical fruit, buttered toast and spice flavors. It's the kind of wine that makes Chard lovers smile. Best of all, it costs considerably less than  the winery's other Chards and is nearly as good.",91,35.0
1019,Wines & Winemakers,"From old Alvarinho vines, this wine was fermented in wood to round it out and give extra richness. The wine certainly is full-bodied, intensely fruity, packed with apricot as well as citrus flavors. The toast element is as much a presence as a taste, giving the wine the possibility of aging. It's too fresh now; drink from 2016.",92,
1020,Iron Horse,"Ripe, flashy fruit stars in this unoaked Chardonnay, in the form of pineapples, kiwis, limes and pears. The grapes for this delicious wine come from the winery's estate vineyard, in the cool southwestern pocket of the Russian River Valley.",90,27.0
1021,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"With 12% Sémillon in the blend, this is a lovely, fresh, almost exuberant Sauvignon Blanc. Bracing and textural, with good varietal character but no excessive herbaceousness, it's loaded with fruit flavors of melon, grapefruit, kiwi and apple. A fine mix of precision and length.",90,11.0
1022,Siduri,"There is a racy, spicy, biting edge to this young Pinot that nicely expresses the Chehalem Mountains AVA terroir, authoritative and unapologetic for the herbal side of the grape. It lingers and opens into a mélange of red fruits, forest, leaf and loam, still stiff and compact after hours of breathing.",92,29.0
1023,DFJ Vinhos,Ripe apricot and pear flavors give this wine a rich character. It is packed with fruits with a creamy texture and balanced acidity at the end. This crisp wine is ready to drink.,87,15.0
1024,Siduri,"Winemaker Adam Lee goes big on this bottling from the vineyard planted by the two Garys (Pisoni and Franscioni), showing bacon fat, blackberries and graphite on the nose. Once sipped, it veers more tart, with cranberry and just-ripe raspberry picking up some complexity from thyme herbs.",93,55.0
1025,Williams Selyem,"The fruit is sourced from multiple vineyards across the appellation, including Eastside Estate, a vineyard formerly known as 3 Starrs recently purchased by the producer. Aromas of exotic plumeria provide an inviting entry, followed by a subtle, yet lightly rich expression of yellow apple and ample minerality. Everything combines for a balanced wine that's not overly heavy or overripe.",93,39.0
1026,Trapiche,"Mild plum and berry aromas are smell a bit like aromatized soap. With cherry, raspberry and brown sugar flavors, this is a friendly wine without much Pinot character.",85,15.0
1027,Concha y Toro,"Nice aromas of cherry fruit and sweetness are perfectly clean, while the palate is slightly spunky and high in acid, with wild-berry flavors running side by side with red cherry and citrus. Has a tart, blazing side but also very good fruit character and purity",88,22.0
1028,Kunde,"Held back for four years before release, this Zin has achieved a creamy softness. The flavors offer a blast of peppery, briary wild red, black and blue berries and currants, with vibrant hints of bacon, cola and sandalwood. Great value in a Zinfandel this likeable.",88,18.0
1029,Gary Farrell,"This low-production Pinot shows off the elegance and balance you expect from this famous vineyard. The wine is dry and tart in acidity, with drink-me-now cranberry, pomegranate, mushroom and new oak flavors. Decant it for an hour or two.",89,70.0
1030,Montes,"Meaty, dry, lightly herbal berry aromas are reserved and not too pushy. This is choppy feeling on the palate, with pointed acids. Flavors of herbal berry, dark plum, coconut, chocolate and oak finish fresh, long, juicy and oaky.",89,25.0
1031,Undurraga,"Spicy, earthy cherry and cassis aromas are true to the variety. This is juicy, bright and substantive in feel, with red berry, oak spice and herbal flavors. A minty, chocolaty finish full of herbs and spices provides for a good ending.",89,17.0
1032,Robert Mondavi,"A thin, uninspiring wine with citrus and apple sauce flavors and lots of acidity. Tastes watered down, but will do in a pinch.",83,11.0
1033,Louis Latour,"Elegant, structured and mineral, this is an excellent wine at the village level, with its green fruit and its promise of aging. A pure, crisp green aftertaste.",88,
1034,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Feudi di San Gregorio delivers one of the best Fiano's you will ever taste: The wine is rich and smooth with aromas of yellow fruit, nuts and white mineral that accompany you throughout the experience. Drink it with your favorite Mediterranean dishes.",88,24.0
1035,Trapiche,"Every year this wine seems to get better. This vintage deals notes of lemon pie, melon and lychee on the bouquet, which is followed by a palate that's oily yet racy. Flavors of lychee and pineapple are true to Torrontés, while green herb and lime notes stir things up.",89,15.0
1036,Robert Mondavi,"This wine has plenty of honeyed sweetness. The apricot, orange and vanilla flavors are just delicious. Crisp acidity provides the perfect zesty balance.",88,20.0
1037,Wines & Winemakers,"This is a dark wine, with an intense, dry structure and seemingly sweet fruit. It has a dense herb flavor, with notes of black plum, spice and bitter chocolate. Keep for a year.",88,
1038,V. Sattui,"The Black Sears Vineyard has been source to some of Napa's most impressive Zinfandels over the years, for a number of wineries, including Sattui. With this 2011, they've outdone themselves. The wine is so succulent in black cherry, licorice and mocha flavors, it's hard to resist drinking it all right now. Yes, the alcohol is on the high side, but that's the price of such richness.",92,42.0
1039,Chehalem,"Perhaps a bit more time in barrel differentiates this from the equally-good Reserve. This is a smooth, supple, deeply-fruited wine, loaded with layers of black cherry, cola and sandalwood. Milk chocolatey tannins roll through the finish, smooth as silk, lingering and luscious.",93,69.0
1040,Chehalem,"This block selection really works, showing more muscle and meat on its bones than the excellent vineyard-designated bottling. Black fruits, cassis and clean earth are flecked with cinnamon. The wine has authority and power, yet retains a sculpted, fine-tuned precision.",93,50.0
1041,Albert Bichot,"This ripe, smoothly textured wine is rich with apricot and white-peach fruits. Light wood flavors add spice and fill out the texture. With its generous weight, the wine is going to be full and ripe from 2018.",88,
1042,Lynmar,"Thick, rich and tightly wound, this cool-climate wine from near the town of the same name is brightly acidic and floral. A mix of rose petal, violet and dried herbes de Provence on the nose echoes on the palate. Bing and dark cherry provide a sultry fruitiness that never dominates over the piquant cardamom spice. Drink now through 2023.",94,60.0
1043,Lynmar,"This wine comes from the coolest pocket of the producer's estate, the last part typically picked. It offers a study in savory tannin development and thickness, the skins unable to soften gently in the cold. Earthy clove defines the flavor, along with a leathery meatiness and firm structure. A suggestion of black cherry tries to muddle through. Drink now through 2023.",94,70.0
1044,Lynmar,"From the steepest, east-facing block of the estate vineyard, given 15% whole-cluster fermentation, this is a dense, brooding wine, spicy and concentrated in blueberry and black cherry. It has a tenacity of earthiness that never lets go, lingering on the full-bodied palate for days. Drink now through 2023.",94,70.0
1045,Kunde,"Seemingly sweet and oaky, this has buttered popcorn, buttered toast and caramel cream flavors. The fruit suggests pineapples and pears.",85,24.0
1046,Maryhill,"A Cinsault-Counoise blend, this is grapey, tasting of just-ripe berries. The flavors turn a little slender on the midpalate, but it's a pleasant quaffer with balanced tannins.",86,36.0
1047,Maryhill,"The excellent Les Collines Vineyard usually delivers more depth of flavor than this, but a cool vintage may be the culprit. Very light berry flavors, a wash of cement-like mineral and earthy tannins with an herbal edge sum up the flavor profile.",86,32.0
1048,Maryhill,"This is a medium-bodied Merlot, with dark fruit flavors that are cloaked in chewy, chalky, earthy and herbal tannins.",86,25.0
1049,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Aged only in stainless steel, this is a food-friendly offering that shows a bright ruby color, bearing sweet aromas of cherry and raspberry candy. The mouthfeel is clean, crisp and easy.",86,21.0
1050,Lynmar,"It's hard to overstate how deliciously irresistible this wine is, a celebration of the variety that makes a statement of greatness from the first sip to the last. Golden-hued minerality is the star and pillar of support, a worthy dance partner to the twirls of lacy lemon pith, fully expressive tangerine, grapefruit and stone. Lively and complex, it showcases beauty in a glass.",97,70.0
1051,Foxen,"Fresh and tart wild cherry and crushed cranberry meet with intriguing touches of fennel frond, mustard, rose hips, potpourri and tons of garrigue on the nose of this bottling. The palate packs vibrancy into each sip, redolent with flavors of tomato leaf, cherry tomato, kalamata olive, underripe raspberry, anise, bay leaf and even earthy mugwort. It conveys an extreme sense of place.",95,48.0
1052,Foxen,"Hearty plum, deep rose petal, earthy juniper, a touch of charcoal and crushed graphite aromas show strongly on the nose of this bottling from a tiny block in this historic vineyard. The palate packs an awesome combination of tension, energy and power, like a clenched fist in a silk glove, with tangy olallieberry fruit and a menthol character that carries deep into the finish.",95,62.0
1053,Lynmar,"This is a decidedly beautiful wine, a carefully crafted offering of Tahitian vanilla bean, caramelized apple and juicy peach that is integrated and buoyant in acidity. It continues to open and shine in the glass, getting better as it travels along the palate, with a lush finish of preserved lemon that just sings.",95,70.0
1054,Lynmar,"A compelling wine, this begins as a journey into salted country butter, lemongrass and a hint of sea-spray-like brine. Lengthy and spicy, it possesses a great deal of stony minerality that gives it length, breadth and brightness, a vinous come-on to have more.",95,60.0
1055,Testarossa,"Stark minerality, from hot gravel to chipped slate, meets with garrigue elements of lavender and thyme on the nose of this strong bottling that gains a savory quality thanks to roasted-pork aromas. The requisite fruit arrives on the sip, where smashed cranberry meets with pepper spice and dried herbs. The structure is grippy and affords great length in the finish.",94,64.0
1056,Undurraga,"A rich berry aroma and a touch of leafy tomato mark the bouquet. Healthy in feel, this has perky acidity and flavors of red plums, mixed herbs, earth and cola. Dry, juicy and solid on the finish.",87,13.0
1057,Kendall-Jackson,"This has citrus, apricot and honey flavors brightened with crisp acidity. It turns a little sweet on the finish, but it's a lovely wine that should be versatile with a huge range of food.",87,15.0
1058,Testarossa,"Pretty notes of black-cherry blossom and fruit are bolstered by black pepper, dried violets, deep red roses and a touch of cinnamon on the nose of this wine from the region's most famous vineyard. It presents a hearty, earthy style on the palate, with anise, bay leaf, black tea and coffee flavors that spice up the dense elderberry and strawberry fruit.",92,75.0
1059,Casa Santos Lima,"Produced from the Boavista vineyard, the base of Casa Santos Lima, this wine comes from old vines. It is a serious, complex and structured wine that will develop well over many years. Dark fruits, dense tannins and really fresh acidity are integrated into a fine wine. Drink this impressive wine from 2019.",92,25.0
1060,Georges Duboeuf,"Packed with strawberry aromas and red berry fruits, this is a ripe, fruit-forward wine only lightly disturbed by tannins. There is a great juicy quality here.",86,
1061,Georges Duboeuf,"Ripe and also tannic, this is structured wine, its berry fruits pushing through a dry plum skin texture. It is solid and chunky while remaining fresh and fruity.",86,
1062,Columbia Crest,"A very different composition from the 2007 Les Chevaux, this year's blend is 34% Merlot, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Syrah, 8% Cabernet Franc and 8% Malbec. It's a tannic wine, and seems to put a lot of emphasis on the vanilla/tobacco flavors that characterize so many blended reds these days. Fair value, but somewhat generic.",86,15.0
1063,Georges Duboeuf,"This is a soft, open wine, full of ripe berry fruits and red cherries. There is only the lightest tannin, along with bright acidity, a wine that is so ready to drink.",86,
1064,Kunde,"Rich and fine, if a little too sweet and oaky. But those are the popular tastes in Chardonnay, and Kunde delivers. The fruit is potent in pineapple jam and Key lime pie.",87,17.0
1065,Testarossa,"With brisk acidity and a tight, minerally feeling, this Pinot Noir is very dry, showing robust cherry flavors. It seems like an ager, but some raisiny overripeness might compromise it.",87,54.0
1066,Santa Ema,"Lime, green bean and asparagus notes vie for leadership on the nose. The palate is plump, round and a touch creamy, then coastal flavors of green bean, green apple and raw asparagus take over and finish with an oily texture and mildly bitter flavors.",87,15.0
1067,DFJ Vinhos,"This young, ripely fruity wine is made to be drunk quickly and easily. It has light tannins, plenty of red fruits and acidity. It is smoothly textured, with a crisp aftertaste.",87,10.0
1068,Kunde,"A little heavy, thick and jammy, like melted blackberry jelly mixed with alcohol. Okay with pizza, burgers and such.",83,18.0
1069,Louis Jadot,"This Jadot is a combo of long-term contract vineyards and its Régnié Cru, demonstrating that knowing the terroir makes a difference. The blend shows well in this rich, full wine. It reveals ripeness—round and full of strawberry flavors from the 100% Gamay, with a tight layer of mineral acidity at the end.",90,13.0
1070,Santa Ema,"This is a bullish blend of 75% Cabernet Sauvignon with Carmenère and Cab Franc. Aromas of horse hide, mint, baked berries and vanilla lead to a live-wire palate with scratchy tannins and staunch acidity. Flavors of baked berry, cassis, vanilla and herbs finish peppery and lightly herbal. Drink through 2018.",90,75.0
1071,DFJ Vinhos,"The Douro version of Paxis is a blend of Touriga Franca, Touriga Nacional and Tinta Roriz. It is a rounded, smooth and spicy wine, with weight and richness. Packed with red berries and plums, it is fruity and structured, with tannins providing a strong base of support. Drink from 2014.",90,9.0
1072,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Made from Falanghina, a variety native to Campania, this sparkler shows heady aromas of white spring flowers and Golden Delicious apple. The palate is vivacious and refreshing, featuring apple and pear layered with hints of nut and pastry dough.",90,39.0
1073,DFJ Vinhos,"Citrus and ripe yellow fruits weave harmoniously throughout this warm, rich wine. There is no wood, just generous fruitiness and acidity in a creamy texture. It is approachable now, although it will be better from 2016.",88,13.0
1074,DFJ Vinhos,"Planting Alvarinho in the Lisboa region, many miles south of its native Minho, could be risky. But winemaker José Neiva Correia took a chance on the ocean-climate similarities and the result is a wine that's as fresh and crisp as possible. Citrus, green plums and lively acidity all come together in a wine that has a bright, spicy aftertaste.",88,13.0
1075,Williams Selyem,"Textured vanilla-cream and green apple appear initially in this wine, which offers plenty of weight and structure around a core of balanced acidity and fresh lemon zest. Cardamom and vanilla play at the edges alongside elements of savory brine and white flowers. The oak presence is subtle.",92,58.0
1076,Siduri,"Adam Lee takes hold of one of the appellation's iconic vineyards and delivers clean, fresh aromas of mushrooms, raspberries, mocha and graphite. The palate shows soy, shiitake and more raspberry, an excellent study of the grape done in the Siduri style.",92,52.0
1077,Trapiche,"Minerally, earthy aromas of plum and blackberry are oaky and attractive. This is round and well balanced, with cassis, blackberry, spice and herbal flavors settling on a spicy finish led by cardamom and clove notes as well as a smooth feel. Drink through 2017.",91,30.0
1078,Concha y Toro,"Lightly herbal on the nose, but overall there's more ripe berry and toasty chocolate aromas than green. Full, meaty and deep for a value-priced wine, with blackberry and black plum flavors along with a pinch of oregano and basil. Shows good weight and balance throughout. Impressive for a 50,000-case product.",87,8.0
1079,Williams Selyem,"Weir has never been my favorite Williams Selyem Pinot, although it has its fans. The ‘05, as with previous vintages, is dry and tannic, showing a toughness that's almost rustic. The flavors are of cherries, cassis, cola, balsamic-splashed sautéed wild mushrooms and dusty spices. Could do interesting things over the years.",87,56.0
1080,Chehalem,"The Stoller bottling from Chehalem shows some dark, musky flavors, with black cherry fruit wrapped around whiffs of smoke and the commonly found Oregon notes of tomato leaf and bud. Despite its immediate impact, it falls a bit light in the back end, and does not have quite enough weight to support the thick tannins.",87,44.0
1081,Gary Farrell,"There are equal parts strawberry and earth in this Pinot, sourced from the who's who of vineyard sites in Russian River, including Toboni, Hallberg, Floodgate, Rochioli and Bacigalupi. The components come together in mesmerizing ways, making for a balanced and restrained Pinot that's fresh in strawberry and cherry as well as seasonings of herb and cinnamon spice, building power as it goes.",90,45.0
1082,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Barrel spice, pineapple, butterscotch and candlewax aromas are followed by full-bodied tropical-fruit flavors. It displays a lot of richness but retains its sense of balance.",90,17.0
1083,Iron Horse,"This is the driest of Iron Horse's new releases, but it still has a honeyed richness even though the residual sugar is a comparatively low half a percent. It feels refined, fancy and elegant, with delicious raspberry, lime and toast flavors. The blend is 75% Pinot Noir and 25% Chardonnay.",93,50.0
1084,Foxen,"One of the more anticipated alternative whites from Santa Barbara County each year, this wine shows light honey brittle, sour tangerine and a touch of sour cream on a bright and lithe nose. The palate offers delicate cherimoya and soft nectarine fruit cut by lime juice and orange rinds, proving light but bursting with energy and flavors.",91,25.0
1085,Santa Ema,"A zesty wine with more zap and tang than one might expect. That said, it's solid as a rock, with intense flavors of cherry, plum, carob and oak. Call it a bit obtuse, if you will. But even with woody finishing notes of vanilla and cream, this settles on fruit more so than the barrel. Carmenère (78%) with Syrah and Carignan.",90,19.0
1086,Testarossa,"A fine, delicious Chardonnay, less expensive than most of Testarossa's other single-vineyard Chards, but as good. Crisp in acidity, it offers very rich pineapple tart, Key lime pie, golden mango and lemon custard flavors, made even richer by smoky, sweetly caramelized oak.",92,39.0
1087,Kendall-Jackson,"A beautiful, racy Chardonnay, with a streamlined structure that could almost be a fine, barrel-aged Sauvignon Blanc. It's marked by mouthwatering acidity, with savory lemongrass, hay, vanilla and white pepper flavors. First class and elegant as a cocktail sipper.",92,30.0
1088,Montes,"A classic high-end Carmenère, with enticingly rich, chocolaty, herbal aromas. The palate is lush but balanced, with a generous texture, smooth tannins and plenty of depth. Saturated in flavor, with blackberry, herbal notes, chocolate, spiced meat and more. Drink now through 2012.",92,72.0
1089,Kendall-Jackson,"Very fine Chardonnay, marked by brisk, racy acidity and a steely tang to the lemon, lime, white peach and honeysuckle flavors. Very complex and lively, an alluring wine that will take a few years in the bottle.",92,25.0
1090,Gary Farrell,"Dark gold in color, this is a memorably luxurious and vivacious wine, tangy in grapefruit, burnt orange and cardamom. Layered and complex, it evolves as it opens to a lingering tease of butterscotch topped in nutmeg. It is an outstanding vision of an outstanding site, a wine for the ages.",96,60.0
1091,Concha y Toro,"Aromas of baked blackberry are a touch earthy but mostly easy to process. This Cabernet feels solid but not overextracted. Malty, earthy flavors of baked berry fruits and cassis finish with coffee and mocha notes. Drink through 2021.",90,
1092,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"This dense wine is still very young. The fruit still needs to express itself in a wine that is broad and ripe. Give this rich wine, with its creamy texture and touches of spice from wood aging, until 2021.",90,114.0
1093,Louis Latour,"The wine is ripe with red-cherry and plum flavors and plenty of acidity to balance. It is a rounded wine, generous with fruitiness and with a touch of tannin at the end. This is a fine village wine from this attractive appellation.",90,45.0
1094,Williams Selyem,"Perhaps the lightest Pinot in the producer's lineup, and the most readily accessible, this is fresh and fruity. Highlighted in strawberry and cherry, it retains a tension of black tea and earth. Silky on the palate, it finishes as lightly as it started.",90,39.0
1095,DFJ Vinhos,"With the typical dark color of this red grape, this is a dense and firm wine. It has rich plum and berry flavors that are dark as well as juicy. Tannins lace the background to this already delicious wine, finishing with refreshing acidity. Drink from 2016.",90,15.0
1096,Kendall-Jackson,"The winery has sourced this wine from their coastal vineyards, which accounts for its acidity and long hangtime raspberry, persimmon and sour-cherry candy flavors. With a silky texture, it's lovely to drink now.",89,24.0
1097,Siduri,This California-made Oregon Pinot captures a sense of the particular terroir of Chehalem Mountains fruit. Wild strawberries are laced with peppery spice and a streak of cola. Good penetration and texture.,88,39.0
1098,DFJ Vinhos,"A serious, rich wine, this is full of ripe berry fruits and structured tannins that highlight a dry core. It's a complex wine with a light touch of acidity, a pinch of pepper and a firm aftertaste that suggests medium-term aging. Drink between 2014–2020.",87,7.0
1099,Siduri,"Spicy and succulent, with superripe flavors of melted cherry jam, milk chocolate, raspberry pie filling, cola and pepper spice. Dry, but a little too soft for all that richness.",87,30.0
1100,Wines & Winemakers,"This wood-aged wine is now mature. Along with spice and toast, it also has an oxidative character that gives softness and warmth. Its rich flavors are full bodied, bringing out citrus and intense acidity. The wine is ready to drink.",90,28.0
1101,Wines & Winemakers,"Vines grown on sandy soil yield a wine that is accessible now. Full, soft and ripe with red berry fruits, the palate is marked by gentle tannins and an attractive burst of fruity acidity. Drink now.",86,11.0
1102,Trapiche,"Spritzy lemon-lime aromas are attractive; there's lemon meringue and green herbs on the palate, and a narrow, fresh finish to close the deal.",84,7.0
1103,Testarossa,"A first-rate Pinot Noir, dry and firm in structure. There's a solid minerality girding the ripe cherry, red currant and cola fruit, while sweet oak provides an ample, but balanced, coating of vanilla and toast. Luscious now right out of the bottle, and should age for a good eight years.",93,65.0
1104,Williams Selyem,"Very powerful, very strong, almost overwhelming in the sheer wealth of fruit and oak, but balanced with acidity. Winemaker Bob Cabral himself calls it “concentrated.” It detonates on the palate with an almost dessert wine quality of lemons, pineapples, honey, vanilla and minerals, but it's totally dry. Will hold for perhaps six years.",95,50.0
1105,Williams Selyem,"A wonderful wine from one of the best vineyards in Anderson Valley. It's a bit acidic and tannic now, the result of this cool vintage, but time in the bottle should soften and resolve the tartness and astringency. The wine itself is very dry, with flavors of cherries, cola, balsam, Asian spices and oak. Needs aging through at least 2012 to awaken it.",94,62.0
1106,Williams Selyem,"The 2007 vintage was a fabulous one for Williams Selyem, and the Zinfandels benefited from the cool, balanced growing season. The Papera is a big, rich, jammy wine, but also a drily elegant one. It offers waves of raspberry, Fig Newton, red currant and Canadian bacon flavors, with superfine tannins. An exuberant Zinfandel now and for the next six years.",94,48.0
1107,Lynmar,"Lynmar has released this, the first of their 2012 Chardonnays, early, in order to let the fruit star. It's flashy, like a conga line of pineapples, oranges, mangoes, limes and papayas. Tasty, direct and appealing, it would be amazing with bacon-wrapped shrimp.",88,20.0
1108,Concha y Toro,"A mix of tropical and citrus aromas is balanced by classic Leyda scents of bell pepper and jalapeño. This is crystal clear and zesty on the tongue, with cutting acidity. Lemon, tangerine and briny notes create a citrusy flavor profile, while the finish is juicy, crisp and cleansing.",89,22.0
1109,Trapiche,"Dark but reduced aromas of tire and blackberry set up a muscular palate with pinching tannins. Roasted, oaky flavors of spicy berry, clove and cocoa finish with a final woody note and choppy toughness.",88,15.0
1110,Robert Mondavi,"Rich in tropical fruit and citrus flavors and generously oaked, this Chardonnay is made in the modern style, designed to appeal. It's dry and properly crisp, with a fine minerality, but is overworked. You can feel the heavy hand of the winemaker.",86,40.0
1111,DFJ Vinhos,"Solid and chunky, a wine that fills the mouth with its attractive red fruits, structured tannins and a general juicy feel. A fine barbecue wine.",86,8.0
1112,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Made from Aglianico grapes, this fresh rosé is a garnet-pink color, with savory aromas of forest floor, bramble, wild berry and white almond. A touch of sassy spice defines the finish.",86,15.0
1113,Robert Mondavi,"This is a fairly ordinary Merlot. It's dry and pleasantly oaked, with some modest cherry and spice flavors. Yet it's a bit off in texture, with jagged tannins.",86,23.0
1114,Louis Jadot,"Very jammy in character, this is a soft, ripe wine. It seems almost too ripe, a wine that is rounded without great texture. It will be ready to drink by the end of the year.",85,37.0
1115,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"A hint of flinty reduction still plays on the nose, barely letting any of the pure fruit notes escape but both ripe and crisp pear appear. The palate still shows some yeasty funk but convinces with purity, sheer power and concentration. This feels urgent and direct, strong and stony, boisterous with sheer force and drive. This needs time to settle but will be a very convincing, even forceful and energetic Pinot Gris with some bottle age. Drink 2020—2035.",94,80.0
1116,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"Yeasty funk still dominates the nose and only lets a touch of lemon zest through. The palate continues with the zesty background against which flashes of riper fruit appear: juicy pear and luscious tangerine. The fruit expression is ripe but utterly fresh. The taut dry palate is anchored in something cool and fresh, something that expands as texture and fills not only the palate but also the mind. This is fresh and luminous, elegant and fine boned. Drink now through 2030.",94,55.0
1117,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"Something floral and stony appears on the nose, along with a hint of smoke and something uncompromising and hard. The palate then packs a real punch: the wine hits you like a bullet of concentrated freshness and citric verve. This is bundled and effective, delivering a hit of ripened freshness with its lemon-zest dominated, dry tanginess. The finish has something juicy and luscious and is absolutely dry and clean. Totally lip-smacking. Drink now through 2027.",94,55.0
1118,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"A touch of flinty funk hovers on the nose. The palate at first unfurls in a grapefruity zesty texture on which riper notions of pear and peach, quince and smoke are displayed. The merest touch of residual sweetness lends a baroque sheen to this tableau, always countered by spicy zesty freshness while being so seductive. The dry whistle-clean finish still tingles with that aromatic fruit of the concentrated midpalate. A great expression of the great 2015 vintage: rich but streamlined, seductive but contained and therefore all the more intriguing. Drink now through 2035.",94,40.0
1119,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"A touch of funkiness hovers over fresh pear notes. The palate then offers fresh-faced, tart and ripe pear notes, etched with citrus freshness for extra precision and purity. This is so inviting and disarming, it is a joy to savor. Despite the generously ripe fruit, a coolness runs through this, anchoring the flavors in freshness and drive. Simply delicious and so balanced, so you can enjoy it now, though it will cellar well through 2027.",94,55.0
1120,Lynmar,"Weighty and creamy in rich tones of just-picked pineapple and Key lime, this is round and expansive on the palate, with undertones of earth and herb. Complex layers of apple and almond interplay, before a finish of honey and spice lingers.",93,55.0
1121,Columbia Crest,"This wine surprises by being so very pretty—unexpected from such a hot site. Lovely scents of raspberry, strawberry, mint and spice lift the nose; the palate is medium-bodied, nicely tart, perfectly balanced and long. The mix of sweet and tart red fruits lasts deliciously, with the spice adding grace notes. Though blended and aged in 100% new French oak barrels, the oak is muted, and the fruit shines through.",91,35.0
1122,Chanson Père et Fils,"From Chanson's five-acre parcel of the Beaune Grèves vineyard, this is a ripe, softly tannic wine, more dominated by strawberry flavors, rich and deliciously sweet. Not for long-term aging, but worth 2–3 years' waiting.",91,
1123,DFJ Vinhos,"The wine is rich, bringing together two great white grapes. Both give the ripe smooth texture, while the Alvarinho also brings in its crisper charms. Pear and green-plum flavors dominate this intense and concentrated wine. Drink from late 2017.",89,12.0
1124,Wines & Winemakers,"This is big, concentrated wine produced from old vines. It has a dense blackberry fruit backed by layers of firm tannins. Rich and full bodied, it will be better from 2018.",91,18.0
1125,Wines & Winemakers,"Old vines give this ripe and fruity wine both concentration and a fine perfumed character. With a short six months in wood, it's smooth, creamy and rich with apricot and mango flavor, needing some aging. Drink from 2018.",91,22.0
1126,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"This rich and generous wine has weight, concentrated yellow fruit and citrus flavors. Full bodied, its rounded texture is cut by a mineral element that brings the crisp acidity of the vintage. Developing well, it will be best from 2018.",91,82.0
1127,Chehalem,"Young and visibly spritzy, this appealing wine bursts forth with scents of lemon tea and orange blossoms, followed by flavors of orange soda, candied pineapple and stone fruits. It's round and fruity, definitely sweet, but kept lively with plenty of acid and that tongue-tickling spritz.",90,24.0
1128,Concha y Toro,"Neutral white-fruit aromas are slightly oxidized. This Chardonnay feels chunky and creamy, with only moderate acidity. Sweet-leaning flavors suggest canned pineapple, while this feels syrupy and tastes like papaya on a soft finish.",86,17.0
1129,Undurraga,"Peppery, herbal lead aromas settle on lactic, chocolaty oak and berry scents. This feels fresh, grabby and fairly well balanced. Flavors of blackberry, cassis and spice filter down to a solid feeling finish with flavors of cassis, herbs and spice.",87,17.0
1130,Iron Horse,"Nothing but tons of pure Chardonnay flavor in this unoaked wine. It brims with pear, peach, pineapple, green apple, passionfruit and honey flavors that are brightened with citrusy acidity.",87,25.0
1131,Columbia Crest,"This is a changed wine from previous vintages, now emphasizing the berry flavors of the fruit and not shying away from some chewy tannins. It seems more honest and direct, without the wash of vanilla and jam, and more food-friendly as well, with the stuffing to take on a flank or hanger steak.",87,12.0
1132,Columbia Crest,"The blend includes 6% Syrah, and the wine has a pretty plum and blueberry color, that (perhaps by the power of suggestion) carries through into the aromas. It's tight, tart, and clean, offering a mix of berry fruits and a finish lined with vanilla and tobacco. Overall the balance is excellent, the wine juicy and fresh, and the blend just about perfect.",87,8.0
1133,Columbia Crest,"Vivid and snappy, this was fermented in stainless steel, with a small percentage aged in neutral barrels to soften the mouthfeel. It's spicy and fresh, with a mix of fruit flavors including grapefruit and pineapple. A touch of vanilla enlivens the aromas.",87,15.0
1134,Georges Duboeuf,"There is no question about the wood here. It dominates the aroma and the palate, burying the fruit in a smooth, vanilla character. It is a pleasure to drink, but seems to have removed itself from Beaujolais.",87,
1135,Trapiche,"Black and charred at first, with licorice, asphalt and a touch of bacon on the bouquet. The palate is soft, soupy and round, with ripe, saturated berry and fig flavors. Finishes spicy and full, with chewy tannins and ample extract.",87,10.0
1136,Undurraga,"Spicy cherry and plum aromas are dark yet austere. Racy, acidic and full of energy across the palate, this coastal Pinot delivers snappy beams of red plum and raspberry flavors before a lightly spiced finish that goes the distance.",90,24.0
1137,Testarossa,"With buttered toast and vanilla cream flavors, this Chardonnay also has underlying notes of tropical fruits, pears and limes. It's rich and simple.",84,20.0
1138,Georges Duboeuf,"Named after the French soldier who served under George Washington, this is an attractive, upright wine. Acidity and fresh cherries come through strongly along with a dry layers of tannins. It's likely to age at least a few more months, so drink from 2016.",87,
1139,Louis Latour,"From its own estate, this Louis Latour wine is a ripe, strawberry- and juicy plum-flavored wine, sustained by a well- judged dry layer of tannins. It is sweet, the acidity showing through in the red fruits.",89,50.0
1140,Trapiche,"For several vintages running Broquel has nudged the border between very good and excellent, but as in years past the '06 is a touch tangy and racy, with black cherry, plum and berry flavors. It's bold, zippy and quite high-toned, but still it's very competent and held together.",89,17.0
1141,Louis Jadot,"Very fresh, very raspberry, this wine opens gently with sweetness and roundness. The tannins do come into play, but ever so gently, a counterpoint to the sweet, fine fruits that dominate this attractive, relatively early drinking wine.",89,40.0
1142,Testarossa,"The vineyard is in the northwestern, coolest part of the Highlands, which is most susceptible to the chilly winds that blow in from Monterey Bay. You can taste the salty tang of the sea, and the wine certainly is high in acidity. It's also deep in cherry, raspberry, currant, cola and spice flavors. Delicious now, and should mellow over the next six years.",92,59.0
1143,Testarossa,"This regional bottling has been a strong suit of Testarossa over the years, a best-barrel blend from their far-flung coastal empire of vineyards. It's very rich in apricot, pineapple, honeysuckle and smoky oak flavors, and finishes dry and spicy. Shows an elegant complexity that should develop over the next six years.",92,55.0
1144,Gary Farrell,"Aromas of baked sour cherry tart precede pleasing wafts of violet and lavender. From a vineyard planted largely to a field selection of the Swan clone, it offers an expected earthiness and spiciness that intrigues around a core of balanced tension between fruit, acid and oak.",91,55.0
1145,Louis Latour,"A light, delicate wine, with spice and pear flavors, some quince, green plums. To balance this, there is a streak of minerality, which cuts through the fruits.",89,
1146,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Don't let the price tag fool you; this is a sophisticated blend with Merlot, Cab Franc, Malbec and Syrah comprising a quarter of the total. Aromatic and inviting, it brings spicy berry, red currant and Bing cherry fruit into play. Chewy tannins carry a hint of herb, and the presence of new oak is minimal at best. Just a hint of chocolate malt hits in the finish.",87,16.0
1147,Trapiche,"Although Argentina is hardly Pinot Grigio country, this is a tropical-style quaffer with good balance and enough acidity to avoid coming across heavy. Creamy aromas of melon and lychee set up flavors of nectarine and tangerine. A lasting but modest finish is fair and appropriate.",85,10.0
1148,Undurraga,"Earthy plum and cherry aromas are cool and lightly herbal. This feels juicy and tight, but clean. Flavors of herbal plum are a touch roasted, while this everyday Cab finishes spicy and the slightest bit green.",87,11.0
1149,Wines & Winemakers,"Light, crisp and fruity, this is a bright, citrus driven wine. It is dry, full of ripe apricot and grapefruit flavors. The wine is ready to drink.",87,12.0
1150,Wines & Winemakers,"A fruity wine, with juicy red fruits and a balance of light, dry tannins. The wine is dusty, firm, showing some earthy barnyard character. The aftertaste brings out acidity.",84,12.0
1151,Wines & Winemakers,"Perfect apéritif Vinho Verde, light as a feather, attractively laced with citrus and peach flavors. It has a light prickle on the tongue, with a soft aftertaste.",84,9.0
1152,Wines & Winemakers,"Fruity and smooth with bright red fruit and the lightest touch of tannin, this Castelão-dominated blend has a shot of acidity to keep it all crisp. Drink now.",87,12.0
1153,Kunde,"Ripe tangerine, peach jam, vanilla and oak flavors are penetrating in this soft, creamy Chardonnay. It's a ripe, rich wine that's widely appealing.",85,27.0
1154,Testarossa,"This very elegant nose is like a love potion perfume of violet, sterling rose, myrrh and raspberry essence. The flavors veer toward tart raspberry and cranberry, with cola and purple flowers coming through before a brisk acidic finish.",92,61.0
1155,Fess Parker,"This age-worthy wine smells like the shady side of a mountain, with black olive notes and roasted fennel alongside cedar-spiced strawberries and brambly berries. Both firm tannins and pungent acidity fuel the palate, with cherry, raspberry and slightly bitter espresso. Drink 2020–2025.",92,50.0
1156,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"This ripe, full and structured wine is developing well. Rich, dark fruits come complete with juicy acidity and a complex, dense texture. Structure and fruit together promise aging and this wine will be ready to drink in 2016.",92,
1157,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"The power and structure of a Corton-Charlemagne are very evident in this firm and closed wine. At this young stage, it is all about the concentrated texture and weight. The acidity and the rich fruits will come later. Drink from 2018.",92,230.0
1158,Fess Parker,"This clonal study blends rich black cherry and sassafras notes with cola, savory herbs, strong iron and slight scorched rubber aromas. The palate jumps from a red cherry and cranberry tartness right into a toasted sage and pencil-lead character.",87,55.0
1159,Louis Latour,"Ripe quince and white pear flavors are touched with wood. This wine from the Mâcon region, has fresh acidity and some richness.",85,
1160,Williams Selyem,"This is beautifully lilting in preciously defined aromas of rose petal and wild strawberry. From there, it's all subtlety and ethereal elegance. The wine is restrained, nurtured in a basket of nutmeg and graham cracker, as well as freshly packed mushroomy earth. This wine is a stunner right out of the glass, but is sure to continue its fine course through 2022–2025.",97,59.0
1161,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"With its strongly mineral-textured base, this is a complex, impressive wine. It has fruit weight with lychees, mangos and spiced pears along with acidity that gives the wine just the lift it needs. Power and style go hand-in-hand in this wine. Drink from 2019.",96,120.0
1162,Williams Selyem,"Those who think they prefer anything but Chardonnay may be convinced otherwise with this wine. It is so powerfully evocative in crisply rendered Meyer lemon and tangerine notes, with aromas of fresh white flowers teasing provocatively on the nose. Seamless and seductively bright in acidity, it glides down the palate, hinting at a richness that never becomes overdone.",96,65.0
1163,Williams Selyem,"Silky on the palate, this offers exotic aromas of orange blossom and spicy cardamom. Juicy in fresh cherry, it combines structured elegance and plenty of power, amid a mouthwatering quality that's seductively delicious and yet just begs the question of how much more nuanced the flavors will be in time. Drink through 2022.",95,105.0
1164,Williams Selyem,"Fresh-picked Bing cherry delights on the initial entry into this silky Pinot, sourced from a long-famous site in the heart of the Russian River. Medium-bodied and nicely structured, it offers ample concentration around a core of elegance, with a lingering finish of vibrant cherry. Enjoy through 2022.",95,79.0
1165,Williams Selyem,"This vineyard-designated wine reflects its sense of place remarkably well, offering tight dark cherry and blueberry around a strong character of wild earth, tea and herb. High in acidity and minerality, and yet powerfully understated, it's gorgeously drinkable now but will gain further complexity through 2022.",95,78.0
1166,Williams Selyem,"This classic Chardonnay brims in lemon chiffon, stony minerality and luscious pear. The complex, soft, supple layers continue to surprise in the glass, teasing the palate with unexpected notes of nutmeg and Tahitian vanilla.",95,55.0
1167,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"This is a sweet wine, very ripe with a smooth, opulent texture. It's full of lychee and peach flavors, allowing just a corner for acidity and freshness. This is just beginning to develop into its impressive and full potential. Drink from 2018.",95,85.0
1168,Georges Duboeuf,"From dark granite soil, this wine is structured and concentrated. It has ripe black-cherry fruit and spice that add to the mineral texture and firm tannins in the background. Drink this cru wine from late 2017.",88,20.0
1169,Concha y Toro,"Powdery, wayward aromas pick up more raciness and green character with time in the glass. A linear palate flat-lines at lime and green apple in terms of flavors, while the finish brings a slightly vegetal tone.",86,17.0
1170,Louis Latour,"Closed at this stage, the wine has acidity, minerality and the potential of ripe pear and apricot fruit flavors. The wood is showing strongly but will integrate, while the texture promises good aging.",91,75.0
1171,Undurraga,"For a large-production wine (47,000 cases made), this is nice and easy to drink. Tropical fruit aromas are lightly citric. In the mouth, this is fresh and easy, with nectarine and tangerine flavors. Freshness and simplicity are this wine's calling card.",86,13.0
1172,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"This wine, while rich, has all the minerality and crisp texture associated with the appellation. Wood aging adds spice. It needs some aging, not much, and will be ready to drink from 2019.",90,86.0
1173,Louis Latour,This wine has weight and richness. It is ripe with apricot and peach flavors that are happily balanced by a crisp edge of acidity. Its texture will give it a good future. Drink from 2019.,90,78.0
1174,Albert Bichot,"A superb wine, the tannins carrying along the dense structure with ease and grace. The purity of the ripe berry fruit is very marked, with acidity giving freshness to the sweet wine. The whole ensemble is developing well, but will need many years' aging.",95,115.0
1175,Louis Jadot,"This is a wonderful wine, very ripe, the blackberry and sweet fruits all here, While the tannins are solid and concentrated, they are in the center of a lush, beautifully rich series of flavors that range from fruit to licorice to spice. The wine shows great aging potential.",95,95.0
1176,Louis Jadot,"With entrancing smoky aromas, this is a ripe, intense and powerful wine. The tannins are dry, contrasting with the black fruit-juice flavors, black chocolate and a dry final taste. For long-term aging.",95,
1177,Chanson Père et Fils,"Rounded and fat, with the weight and power of white wines from Corton. The texture is taut, still very young, waiting to allow the full richness of the fruit to come through. Impressive, it needs a minimum of four years aging.",95,
1178,Chanson Père et Fils,"With its solidly dry tannins, this is a powerhouse, very dark in texture, very structured. The fresh fruit is just showing from all this intensity. Still very youthful, this is an impressive wine for aging over many years.",95,
1179,Chanson Père et Fils,"A foursquare, solid wine that shows its structure right up front. It is backed by red fruits and acids that lend a warm feeling. Full and dense, this needs to age.",88,68.0
1180,Kendall-Jackson,"Here's a rich, flashy Chardonnay. It has a fat, butter-and-cream mouthfeel, with waves of pineapple tart, lemon meringue, buttered toast and honey flavors that finish soft and lush.",88,15.0
1181,Williams Selyem,"This is a soft, complex and floral wine, sourced from an estate vineyard on Westside Road. Black cherry, tangerine and oak reduction make for a bright, brooding combination of medium-bodied lushness and subtle power.",94,105.0
1182,Montes,"This Merlot smells rooty, with licorice and mint to boot. A wide, sort of flabby palate is, at its base, oaky as can be; there's also stewed plum and herbal blackberry flavors in front of a blocky, chunky finish.",86,25.0
1183,Casa Santos Lima,"This wine is soft and creamy with melon and green apple flavors. Light, fruity and crisp, it is ready to drink.",84,10.0
1184,Georges Duboeuf,This is a bright and fruity wine with attractive red-cherry flavors and light tannins. It has crisp acidity and a fresh aftertaste. The wine is ready to drink.,84,15.0
1185,DFJ Vinhos,"This medium-sweet rosé is bursting with ripe strawberry aromas and flavors. It is soft, just edged by crispness and ready to drink with its light, fruity finish.",84,9.0
1186,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"A fine bottle — full, fleshy, immediately throwing out dense aromatics with toast and roasted coffee and bitter chocolate components. A deep vein of black cherry and cassis keeps the core tight and focused, and a small splash of Syrah adds the scent of black pepper.",91,28.0
1187,Kendall-Jackson,"Nicely ripe fruit flavors and a full rounded texture give this affordably priced wine more presence than most. The aroma is honeydew melon and the flavors are ripe apple and Anjou pear, while the acidity is on the soft side.",89,13.0
1188,Maryhill,"After its rather sugary 2006 version of this wine, Maryhill has returned to a more authentic, grassy style in 2007, with the alcohol back up over 14%. It's a big improvement, showing varietal character and ripe flavors of melon and grapefruit.",87,12.0
1189,Montes,"Maybe a little more ripe and heady than some of its Chilean buddies, but this SB from Montes offers freshness, zip and good citrus, tarragon and other green-herb flavors. The feel is good, the character fresh, and the finish long and clean. Offers maybe a little more green-leaf character than some might like, but overall this is another fine value SB from Chile. Drink immediately.",87,12.0
1190,Santa Ema,"Neutral and clean, with hints of melon, apple and cucumber. For a 2007, this is still holding its own. It offers just enough richness and body to tease, but mostly it's a textbook Chilean SB with apple, grapefruit and gooseberry flavors along with a pithy finish. Gracious and tasty, but drink now.",87,9.0
1191,Williams Selyem,"Not showing well now due to the tannins. It's dry and tough, with a resistance to the richness. Yet the core of flavor is enormous. Shows concentrated, flashy flavors of cherry marmalade, raspberry, orange blossom, cola, licorice, rose tea and spices that go on and on and continue to develop in the glass. The texture is pure silk and satin. Needs 4–6 years to develop, and could go beyond that.",97,78.0
1192,Williams Selyem,"The winery's philosophy is, if you're going to make a dessert wine, why not make it fabulously sweet instead of boringly off-dry? With 17.5% residual sugar, this indeed hits the limit of the sweetness scale. Yet it's superbly balanced with acidity, giving a refreshing balance to the intense apricot jam, lemon drop, candied ginger, pineapple crème brûlée and vanilla custard flavors. A tremendous success for a California dessert wine.",96,40.0
1193,Williams Selyem,"Pretty tannic, with a hard edge, although it's very fruity and rich, and should soften and mellow with time in the cellar. Thoroughly dry, it shows complex flavors of wild raspberries, cherry compote, cola and spices, compounded with smoky, sweet oak. Give it until 2011 to begin to come around.",95,54.0
1194,Undurraga,"Banana and lacquer aromas blend with pickled white fruit scents and brine. It's by no means a fresh and inviting Chardonnay; instead, it's a bit mustardy and briney, and not terribly fresh in feel. Is that sauerkraut on the finish?",82,20.0
1195,Kendall-Jackson,"This full-bodied wine is complex and detailed from the spicy perfume to the finish, and rich and satisfying in the middle. Aromas like black tea and rhubarb lead to ripe and deep cherry and slightly tangy raspberry flavors that are lifted by moderate tannins and linger on the finish.",92,20.0
1196,Testarossa,"Welcoming on the nose, this top-end bottling offers aromas of baked red cherry, clove and black plum before diving into crushed graphite, wet slate and loamy mud aromas. Soft on the palate but immediately vibrant with acidity, flavors of dark cranberry and tart cherry are lifted by anise-like spice.",92,80.0
1197,Testarossa,"Comprised solely of the richer 667 clone, this bottling from the Talley family's iconic vineyard offers juicy blackberry, chipped slate, fennel frond and cola notes on the nose. Smashed black raspberry, strawberry and boysenberry are front-loaded on the palate, but then comes the underlying rush of thyme and anise.",92,64.0
1198,Bründlmayer,"Often Bründlmayer will make a sweet wine from the Muscat grape. This wine is dry, with an intense, perfumed character. This is full and rich, with lychee and quince flavors.",88,
1199,Williams Selyem,"The raspberry, cherry and blackberry flavors are delicious, and the oak brings just the right touch of sweet, smoky toast. The tannins are rich and fine, and the palate bears a streak of citrusy acidity that cuts right down the middle. It should mellow with 5–6 years in the bottle.",88,56.0
1200,Bründlmayer,"Pure lemon zest mingles with peppery pungency and makes for pepper-speckled refreshment. Linearity and focus abound and this wine is so lively, it seems to fast-forwarded into the future.",92,34.0
1201,Louis Jadot,"Very minerally in character, this is taut and edgy, laced with acidity, citrus fruit and a tangy character. It's bright, crisp and so fresh.",85,
1202,Georges Duboeuf,"The softest of the Pouilly Fuissés produced by Duboeuf, this is a smooth, creamy and toasty wine. A peach note and warm, ripe fruits dominate. Very ready to drink.",85,21.0
1203,Casa Santos Lima,"This wine gets its name from the fossils that abound in the landscape of the vineyards. A blend of Arinto, Viognier and Chardonnay, it is ripe and perfumed. The texture is smooth, but with a mineral edge. Yellow fruits dominate the flavor profile that's balanced with acidity. Drink the wine now.",89,13.0
1204,DFJ Vinhos,"A firm, structured blend of 50-50 Pinot Noir and Touriga Nacional, this wine is rich and made to age. A dense texture underlies the ripe blackberry fruits and firm tannins. Aged for 18 months in wood, the wine needs time to mature further. Drink from 2018.",91,19.0
1205,Kendall-Jackson,"This is a well-made wine at a more-than-fair price. Labeled varietally, it also holds smaller additions of other Bordeaux red grapes, most notably 6% Cabernet Franc. Black pepper, leather and cassis surround smoky oak and firm, integrated tannin, making for a complex, full-bodied and balanced experience.",91,24.0
1206,Kendall-Jackson,"Very fine Chardonnay, marked by brisk, racy acidity and a steely tang to the lemon, lime, white peach and honeysuckle flavors. Very complex and lively, an alluring wine that will take a few years in the bottle.",92,25.0
1207,Wines & Winemakers,"A smooth and rich wine that is already delicious. It has ripe berry fruits, soft tannins and a full, juicy feel. A streak of acidity cuts through this generous wine. Drink now.",87,12.0
1208,Testarossa,"Mulberry, wet rock and sagebrush show on the nose of this single vineyard bottling from a site owned by the Hahn family. The palate is tangy at first, revealing dark red fruit with a smoky kick as it opens, backed by hints of juniper and dust.",91,67.0
1209,Kendall-Jackson,"A staple of California winemaking, this vintage is as good as ever—perfectly polished, with light aromas of toasted oak and crisp green apple, lemon-lime and tempting butter flavors, and a medium-bodied frame. The texture is silky smooth, and everything tastes harmonious and balanced.",91,17.0
1210,Undurraga,"It's taken time, but Undurraga has finally hit paydirt with this Limarí Syrah. Cool, gritty aromas of black olive, herbs, asphalt, cassis and boysenberry are stacked and complex. This feels just plush enough, but with bracing acidity. Flavors of hard spices, pepper, wild herbs and leather blend with plum and berry notes prior to a savory, meaty, leathery finish. Drink through 2020.",91,25.0
1211,Williams Selyem,"As usual with a Hirsch Pinot, the wine is young and thick and jammy, even a little heavy, and needs time to develop. The wild raspberry, sour cherry, cola and Asian spices have a touch of smoky new oak, while the tannins and acids are noticeable, providing a dry architecture for the ripe fruit. Should develop over the next decade, as everything comes together into balance.",93,72.0
1212,Albert Bichot,"This is pure mineral, chalk and lean austerity initially, but opens up with apples,  lime and green plums. It is intense, concentrated and structured; needs time. Wait 4–5 years.",93,65.0
1213,Lynmar,"A remarkably good wine at this price. Lemon meringue and custard meet creamy stone fruit in a balanced, decadent way, a suggestion of orange whip tugging at the edges of the palate. It glides down easy, impressing further with every sip, remaining balanced and graceful.",92,25.0
1214,Albert Bichot,"This is a textured, dense and concentrated selection that has notes of white fruits and white flowers. It's a wine for medium-term aging.",88,
1215,Fess Parker,"This wine demonstrates Viognier's exotic side, with flavors of tropical fruit, tangerine, white flower, vanilla, honey and spice. Despite the richness, it's dry and the acidity is mouthwatering. Don't serve this too cold, and pair it with Asian fare that's slightly sweet.",88,25.0
1216,Albert Bichot,There is a touch of minerality in this wine as well as a dry edge and ripe red-fruit flavors that are already attractive. It should be aged at least three years.,88,
1217,Kunde,"A rustic, barnyard aroma greets one on the nose before a basic taste of stewed prunes waltzes in.",82,17.0
1218,Georges Duboeuf,"Firmly tannic, this is a solid, chunky wine. It's full of dark plum, black currant and cherry flavors that fill out the firm, dry structure. Concentrated while also fruity, it's worth aging for a year.",91,14.0
1219,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"A deep, dense blackberry flavor suggests that this is cellar worthy. Notes of ground coffee, cacao and clean earth abound. The finish is long and compact, with nicely polished tannins.",91,31.0
1220,Trapiche,"Minty and toasty upfront, this is layered with blackberry, licorice, leather and toast aromas. It feels raring and ready to go, courtesy of firm acidity and good overall framing. Flavors of wild berry are bright, with herb and oak accents. Long, toasty and solid on the finish.",91,15.0
1221,Kunde,"This has been the source of some good to excellent Zins for Kunde over the years. They say the vines are 125 years old. The wine is dense and layered, with dried briary fruit, sweet black currant, licorice, leather and Asian spice flavors that are wrapped into punchy, somewhat aggressive tannins. The alcohol is very high, but the wine doesn't taste hot or unbalanced.",91,35.0
1222,Bründlmayer,"Grapefruit zest, yeast and freshly cut kitchen herbs add to the enticing flavor of green pear on this light-footed, energetic wine. There is lots of drive, joy and ease. Yet there's nothing facile here—just the most nimble expression of clean-cut, refreshing Grüner.",91,25.0
1223,Kendall-Jackson,This unoaked Chardonnay is powered by tangy lemon and pineapple flavors. It's medium-bodied and has nice concentration without seeming overly ripe. Butter and vanilla touches weave through its lively fresh fruit notes.,88,17.0
1224,Bründlmayer,"Smoke and flintstones play among green pear and savory yeast notes. The palate reveals a yeasty, cushioned texture, framed by grapefruit zestiness. The finish is clean-cut but persistent and is set to evolve over the years.",92,36.0
1225,Kunde,"This estate wine comes from vines planted two decades ago and was named for John Drummond, who owned the land in the 1800s. With a touch of Cabernet Franc in the mix, it offers black licorice, buoyant acidity and a back beat of tannin that integrates well. Bark, dark plum and chocolate round out the full-bodied picture.",90,50.0
1226,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"The aromas on this wine are light and nuanced with notes of pear, butter and pineapple. It's full bodied in feel, clean in style showing good weight and viscosity while retaining a pleasing sense of lightness.",90,20.0
1227,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Wines from the extinct Vulture volcano in the deep south of Italy tend to show a linear, elegant side, with etched mineral notes of smoke and crushed granite. This wine offers all those characteristics, but does so with a modern twist, showing notes of spice and plush red fruit.",90,28.0
1228,Robert Mondavi,"This isn't Mondavi's most expensive Fumé (Sauvignon) Blanc. But it is one of their best ever. In fact, it's so classic, you could use it in a winemaking class to teach future vintners about how great Napa Sauvignon Blanc should taste. It's bone dry, brilliantly crisp with acidity and gently touched by oak. The main notes are of lees, which give a sourdough tang, and layers of lemons, limes, pink grapefruits, gooseberries and rich tropical fruits. An unbelievable value at this price, but only 1,975 cases were produced.",95,32.0
1229,Undurraga,"Ultra-fresh and snappy, but a little light and neutral when it comes to fruit character. The palate is totally spunky and alive, with bouncy but mild flavors of lime, white grapefruit and orange. Clean and likable, with good focus but only medium-level intensity and power. Drink now.",87,17.0
1230,Wines & Winemakers,"Alvarinho from the north of the Vinho Verde gives a ripe, creamy textured wine that also has a cool feel to it. It is juicy, with a fine floral character as well as ripe lemon and apple flavors. Drink this wine now.",87,20.0
1231,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"Vines planted between 900 and 1,200 feet above sea level give this cool interpretation of Pinot Noir. The wine is crisp, lightly structured with some tannins and with a delicate cherry and red-berry fruitiness. It will be ready to drink from 2017.",87,33.0
1232,Fess Parker,"This easy-drinking blend of 86% Viognier, 8% Roussanne, 3% Marsanne and 3% Grenache Blanc—featuring a sailboat painting by Santa Barbara artist Chris Potter—offers aromas of flambéed bananas and toasted coconut on the nose. The palate shows grapefruit pith and the warmth of browned pears and seared red apples, seasoned with a nice sparkle of acidity.",88,19.0
1233,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"The herb, grapefruit, tropical fruit and melon aromas are light but very varietal. The palate has a slight spritz that perks up the tangy fruit flavors.",88,16.0
1234,Columbia Crest,"All varietal, this wine is a blend of fruit from Beverly, Shaw and Stone Tree vineyards. Aged in all-new French oak, it leads with barrel spices followed by aromas and flavors of medicine cabinet, cherry and chocolate. It offers appeal but the tannins need time to unwind.",88,45.0
1235,Trapiche,"Smoky, rubbery, heavily oaked aromas sit on top of a stocky, creamy palate. This blend of Malbec, Bonarda and Syrah is plump and candied, with hickory, bacon and generic black-fruit flavors resting on lemony acidity.",85,13.0
1236,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"A banner vintage delivers a wine with nicely delineated layers of flavor, from fleshy tropical fruit into streaks of slightly bitter-skin flavors, herb and banana cream pie. It's long, lush and deliciously lively.",90,36.0
1237,Fess Parker,"From a vineyard on the western edge of the cool climate appellation comes this great wine, with touches of butter, almond, white flower buds and lime pith on the nose. The palate is high and tight, structured by Meyer lemon pith, made savory by sea salt and warmed up with savory melted butter on the finish.",92,37.0
1238,Gary Farrell,"Tart and tangy in orange and lime, this wine conveys an undeniable freshness that one won't soon forget, with a bright, focused acidity at its core. Mouthwateringly succulent in lemon custard and brioche as it develops and lengthens in the glass, it offers the best of vibrancy and voluptuousness.",93,60.0
1239,Louis Latour,"This wine is textured, with a firm backdrop to the ripe white fruits. Acidity cuts through everything, giving a fragrant character. Drink this developing wine from 2018.",91,85.0
1240,Wines & Winemakers,The stupidly heavy bottle is off-putting. That's a shame as the wine itself is ripe and impressive. Rich lemon and pear fruits go with touches of wood spice and a mineral texture. They blend well in a full and generous wine that is now ready to drink.,91,28.0
1241,Trapiche,"Quite piercing on the nose, with unyielding cherry and hard-spice aromas. The palate is also intense, with saturated black cherry and raspberry flavors riding rough on a tight frame. Not the most friendly and easy Malbec.",84,12.0
1242,Columbia Crest,"An uneasy mix of steel and butter, this may just need a bit more time to settle. At the moment, the twin elements of metal and popcorn clash and compete. For those who love the buttery style, this should prove pleasing.",86,12.0
1243,Trapiche,"After whiffs of burnt rubber and char blow off, this berry-packed Cabernet hits like a small brick with black fruit flavor, which packs punch and aftershocks of cocoa and coffee. Chunky, rough and warm.",85,10.0
1244,Georges Duboeuf,"A soft, fragrant red-cherry flavor dominates this fruity, open and easy wine. Very ready to drink, it has attractive acidity and a light spice to the finish.",85,
1245,Testarossa,"That terrific Santa Rita acidity is there, and the oak regimen tastes very expensive, but the fruit doesn't seem up to the task. It's a pretty good wine, with pineapples, dates, crème brûlée and spices, but there should be greater richness and complexity from this esteemed vineyard.",86,39.0
1246,DFJ Vinhos,"This is a soft, rounded and fruity wine that is already ready to drink. It has dark berry notes, spicy accents and a strong layer of acidity to keep it fresh. Tannins show through gently, softly, just enough to give the wine structure. Drink now and until 2018.",85,9.0
1247,Gary Farrell,"From two of the most coveted sites in the appellation, this wine showcases an elegant ripeness and rapturous relationship to fruit. Dried sage and forest overtones complement concentrated flavors of fig, orange and dried cherry. It offers ample structure and is beautifully put together.",94,75.0
1248,Kunde,"This dry, brusque Merlot has hard tannins and tart acidity, and the fruit isn't very concentrated. Gets by with a taste of black cherries and currants. Drink up.",85,20.0
1249,Kunde,"Very dry, with mouth-watering acidity, but the palate also searches for a little more fruit than the wine offers. Still, the pineapples, peaches and apricots are pleasant enough.",88,33.0
1250,Louis Jadot,"From a small village in the Côte Chalonnaise that specializes in Aligoté, this is a bright wine with delicious acidity and refreshing lightness. It's made to be drunk young and is ready now.",87,27.0
1251,Concha y Toro,"Horsey aromas infringe upon basic cherry and tomato scents. This is lean on the palate, with scouring acidity. Tart, spicy plum and cherry flavors end on a crisp, dilute finish with that reverberates with sour plum and cherry notes.",85,11.0
1252,Santa Ema,"With tight, crisp aromas of berry fruit, toast, mineral and mint, this Cabernet Sauvignon blend is high toned—coming across racy and snappy. Jumpy, lively plum and raspberry flavors are backed by leafy, herbal notes and resiny oak. A spicy mint finish concludes this energetic yet oaky blend. Drink through 2021.",90,50.0
1253,Santa Ema,"Early aromas of menthol and oak settle on floral red berry scents and woodspice. The flavor profile of black cherry and berry is initially narrow, but with time rounds out to deliver a bright, pleasant overall character. The blend consists of 75% Carmenère, 25% Syrah and 5% Carignan.",90,24.0
1254,Concha y Toro,"Herbal, saucy aromas of tomato and spice accent dark-berry fruit, while the palate carries a tight, fresh, crisp feel. This brings herbal, spicy notes along with berry and cassis flavors, while the finish rolls out in loamy yet short fashion.",88,11.0
1255,Georges Duboeuf,"Ripe and delicious, this is full of fruit along with balanced structure. It is lively, with some youthful acidity as well as rich red berry flavors. It's ready to drink now.",88,13.0
1256,Columbia Crest,"This very limited reserve is from a particular block, and as with most block selections, it offers focused, somewhat constrained flavors. Precisely defined red berry fruit is set in a frame of vanilla, toast and coffee. It's a pleasant, albeit generic quaffer.",88,30.0
1257,Trapiche,"If you get at this now you may still enjoy the wine's freshness. Aromas of apricot and apple are clear and unadulterated by oak. The flavors of lemon, apple, pineapple and green papaya are zesty, while lasting acidity on the finish leaves a cleansing, wet impression.",85,7.0
1258,Trapiche,"Generic red-fruit aromas are accented by sage and thyme, while in the mouth the feel is wiry. Full-blooded raspberry and cherry flavors come with pronounced acidity and lighter-framed tannins, so there's some sharpness. All in all it's a no-frills red wine with minimal Cabernet character.",85,12.0
1259,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Vibrant and structured, this expression of Aglianico opens with a fragrance that recalls blue flower, dark woodland berries, forest floor and balsamic notes. The polished palate offers red cherry, black pepper, licorice and menthol alongside subtle oak. It's well balanced but still young, with nervous acidity and assertive tannins. Drink after 2018.",90,30.0
1260,Foxen,"This is easily the greatest of Foxen's new Chardonnays. It show the dryness and crisp acidity of the other bottlings, but is enormously rich and complex in oak-inspired pineapple, peach, crème brûlée, buttered toast, honey and mineral flavors. Decant for a while to let it mellow, and it should develop bottle complexity through 2014.",94,32.0
1261,Testarossa,"A great Syrah, from a winery better known for Pinot. The wine shows true power in the blueberry, blackberry, mulberry, spice and smoke flavors. Yet it's so elegantly constructed, with fine Central Coast acidity and imposingly rich, fine tannins. An important wine that should have an interesting future over the next 6–8 years.",94,54.0
1262,Gary Farrell,"Farrell's 2007 lineup of Chardonnays is a triumph, and this Starr Ridge is among their best. It's a big wine, rich in tropical fruit, peach, green apple, mineral and oak flavors that completely satisfy now. Yet there's an acidic urgency that suggests aging for up to six years, by which time the wine should achieve a honeyed creaminess.",94,50.0
1263,Maryhill,"Aromas of barrel toast, kiwi and pineapple lead to a sweet, slightly lean, tropical-fruit-filled palate that delivers a lot of easy-drinking pleasure.",88,25.0
1264,Siduri,"An appellation wine that's affordable and instantly likable, this has strong forest and mushroom elements, seeming at once rustic and sophisticated. Cranberry and orange tones add brightness to the savory character, framed by fine tannins.",90,35.0
1265,Louis Latour,"The wine has the right weight and power. It comes from a blend of different parcels, bringing out the complexity of the vineyards. Black fruits are soft and generous, supported by tannins as well as licorice and wood flavors. At the end, fresher red fruits show.",93,280.0
1266,Louis Latour,"From the village of Blagny, considered part of Meursault, this full, rounded wine has a generous character, full of ripe fruit. It is given a crisper side by good acidity, and shows both freshness and weight at the end.",93,70.0
1267,Louis Latour,"Rich and sweetly fruity, this wine wields intense power. Red fruits are initially opulent and pleasurable, but then the wine begins to show solid structure and concentration. The final texture, with its tannins and fruit in harmony, is impressive. Drink from 2018.",93,280.0
1268,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Still settling into the bottle, this wine is aromatically quiet, with notes of white flowers and pear. It drinks off dry, with generous amounts of stone-fruit flavors. If the aromas blossom, it could move up a notch as the flavors are quite well proportioned.",88,16.0
1269,Columbia Crest,"Barrel aromas of vanilla and mocha are at the fore, followed by blue fruit and blackberries. The palate displays a mixture of fruit and barrel flavors that linger through the finish.",88,12.0
1270,Kunde,"A majority of Cabernet Sauvignon makes up this wine, blended with 14% Malbec, 14% Merlot, 10% Petit Verdot and 2% Cabernet Franc. Thick and velvety with strong notes of dark chocolate, espresso and brambly blackberry, it has a juicy middle before finishing fairly flat.",88,35.0
1271,Gary Farrell,"This is a single-vineyard Chard grown on Westside Road, in the heart of the northern valley's Pinot country. It's a very elaborated wine, high in acidity, showing tiers of tart green apple, Kaffir lime, pear, smoky oak, and Champagne-like lees and brioche flavors. Just great, and should hold for six years or more.",94,38.0
1272,Gary Farrell,"Dryness and acidity mark this terrific wine. It's one for connoisseurs, a Pinot that requires some understanding to fully appreciate, as it's not a hedonistic seducer. The cherry and blackberry flavors have a fruit-skin bitterness, and there are additional nuances of violets, cola, leather, balsam and smoky oak. This is certainly one for the cellar. Drink now, with decanting, and over the next eight years.",94,65.0
1273,Kendall-Jackson,"One of the riper of the Highland Estate's current crop of Cabernets, the Hawkeye Mountain shows intense varietal character. It's rich in black currants and cedar, with a tangy minerality and firm but pliant tannins. A beautiful Cabernet, at its best now and through 2015.",93,55.0
1274,Gary Farrell,"A Brilliant Chardonnay, picked relatively early compared to some, but that has kept the alcohol moderate and the acidity brisk, making the wine crisp and even flinty. The flavors veer toward green apples, Asian pears, Meyer lemons, limes and other juicy, acid-inspired fruits.",93,38.0
1275,Gary Farrell,"Farrell's Starr Ridge Dijon bottling is a fruity wine, bright and forward in red and black cherry, black raspberry, licorice and cola flavors, with smoky oak elaborations and a floral scent of violets. All that richness is balanced with crisp acids and even a dusting of fine tannins. Brilliant and pure, this Pinot should provide fine drinking through the age of six years or more, depending on how you like your older wines.",93,50.0
1276,Kendall-Jackson,"Just might be the best $25 Chard out there. Gorgeous and dramatic in opulence, with a creamy texture, and tremendous in ripe tropical fruit, smoky oak and vanilla flavors. There's a long, honeyed, buttercreamy finish.",93,25.0
1277,Albert Bichot,"Firm and tannic, this is a dense wine. Its weight and richness promise a good future. It is juicy, full of red-cherry flavors and with plenty of perfumed acidity. The wine will be ready to drink from 2023.",93,
1278,Siduri,"There's a slightly gamy, pleasantly rustic touch to the nose of this hearty bottling, with a broad and deep boysenberry base spiced up by dark cola, nutmeg and wet gravel aromas. The mouthfeel is very full and the tannic structure is tight, propping up flavors of dark mulberry, tree bark and more roasted game.",93,55.0
1279,Siduri,"Baked black cherry meets with nutmeg, clove and dried ginger on the very inviting nose of this bottling by Adam Lee. A sizzling acidity greets the palate, as do muscular tannins, with flavors of dark-red fruit, allspice and gingerbread falling into place.",93,55.0
1280,Kunde,"This is a sound Cabernet Sauvignon. It's very dry and quite tannic, with pure blackberry, black currant and blueberry flavors, and it finishes with a soft gentleness. At its best now, and the price is good for the quality.",87,17.0
1281,Robert Mondavi,"Here's a good, sound Merlot that's fancy enough to serve with special fare. It's dry and rich in tannins, with oak-inspired black cherry, currant and pepper flavors. Easy to find, with 29,000 cases produced. The alcohol measures 16%.",87,23.0
1282,Montes,"Warm, rubbery berry aromas mixed with smoked meat and herbal accents make for a solid nose, and while the palate has clampy acidity and herbal notes, there's ample body, roundness and berry fruit to bring it home. Both leafy and candied on the finish.",87,24.0
1283,Montes,"Clean and ripe, with apple, pear and zesty citrus aromas. The palate runs more round and candied than linear and sharp, with sweet, welcoming flavors of white peach and dried citrus fruits. Fuller-bodied and inviting, but still fresh. Drink immediately.",87,12.0
1284,Foxen,"For years, Foxen has been producing one of the best Chenin Blancs in California, and with this 2009, they have outdone themselves. It's so rich in orange, honeydew and pineapple flavors, it might almost be Chardonnay, except it's drier and more minerally, and there's a wonderful note of dried herbs. Although production was only 575 cases, this wine is worth a special search, especially for sommeliers.",93,22.0
1285,Testarossa,"A controversial wine due to its amazing power. It's just tremendous in apricot, peach, nectarine, marzipan and crème brûlée flavors, like some dainty from a great pastry chef. But this oversized quality makes it difficult to enjoy with food. Almost better on its own as a cocktail sipper.",89,44.0
1286,Concha y Toro,"Briary and prickly smelling, with juicy acidity, a lean structure and tart pie cherry and red plum flavors. Expect a light, translucent Pinot that emphasizes freshness and crisp acidity.",84,12.0
1287,Concha y Toro,"A little forced and pickled on the nose, but overall this is pretty much your standard value-priced Chilean Cab, meaning it offers herbal notes and olive along with medium-level currant and plum flavors. Very basic and by no means a bad wine.",84,8.0
1288,Columbia Crest,"Freshly cut pear and tropical aromas lead to medium-bodied flavors. The style is clean and well made, with the concentration dipping a bit at times.",85,12.0
1289,Louis Latour,"This is tight, with acidity that cuts through the red fruits and perfumed raspberry flavors. It is light and bright, with minimal tannin and just a hint of structure.",85,40.0
1290,Undurraga,"On the nose, this Cabernet-led blend deals telltale Chilean aromas of herbs, pepper, spice, berry, tomato and forest floor. Derivative of a cool year, the palate feels tight, with snapping acidity. Hard-hitting acid-driven flavors of spiced berry and black currant finish dark, toasty and oaky, but pulling. Drink through 2025.",91,70.0
1291,Columbia Crest,"The latest release of the H3 Chardonnay shows plenty of fruit upfront (20% was fermented in stainless steel). Firm, crisp apple and a buttery finish set this clearly in the mainstream Columbia Crest style.",87,15.0
1292,Robert Mondavi,"From one of the Napa Valley's most historically famous sites, this Cab delivers a testament to gamy blackberry and blueberry alongside complex cassis, clove and black licorice. Full bodied and richly concentrated, it's also soft and well integrated, entirely pleasurable now, with years to go in terms of structure and body. Cellar through 2027 and possibly beyond.",94,145.0
1293,Albert Bichot,"There is good weight here. Its richness and fruits offer light red plum textures, a dry tannic character as well as some good power. Complexity and sweetness both promote a concentrated wine.",90,
1294,Undurraga,"Solid, crisp and consistent with the previous vintage. Undurraga's T.H. from Leyda is a Sauvignon Blanc made in the oceanic, cool-climate style. It's stripped of all fat and weight; instead, it hits with tangerine, orange and a bit of green. A nice example of a streamlined, fit white wine.",89,17.0
1295,Testarossa,"Ripe Anjou pear, Key-lime skins, white lily and white peach show on the nose of this wine from an increasingly popular vineyard. The palate is clean and straightforward, with pear cider, Gala apple and concrete minerality.",89,48.0
1296,Albert Bichot,"This wine has equal amounts of ripe berry fruit and structure. There is a smoky character, wood and spice notes, balanced acidity and a leather-like touch to the texture. It is slowly developing, and it has the potential to be rich. Age this for 6–8 years.",90,
1297,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Bright aromas of rose petals and lychee are followed by lightly spritzy, off-dry fruit flavors. It delivers easy-drinking appeal.",87,9.0
1298,Louis Jadot,"From vineyards owned by the Gagey family, this wine is ripe, easy to drink and full of fruit. Its strawberry and red cherry flavors are lifted by acidity and grounded in balancing tannins. It is made to be drunk young and will be ready from late 2017.",87,38.0
1299,Kunde,"Buttery peach crumble and vanilla bean flavors are balanced by floral aromas and a rounded, likable character in this bold, full-bodied white.",90,30.0
1300,Concha y Toro,A neutral nose offers mild notes of minerally rich vitamin but almost no discernible fruit. Lightly oaked pear flavors are distant and turn bitter in front of a finish that stands still.,84,11.0
1301,Santa Ema,"Cherry and cassis aromas are generic. This feels raw and choppy, with sharp tartartic acidity. Limited, herbal flavors of mint and red fruits end in abrasive style.",84,10.0
1302,Louis Latour,"Not quite as big as the Bâtard, Latour's Corton-Charlie is the house's flagship (the company owns 10 hectares of the grand cru) and most ageable wine. The 2000 boasts aromas of gunflint, pear, smoked meat and buttered toast. White peaches emerge on the palate, but the primary flavors are of minerals and spice. Finishes with tons of citrus and an almost tannic feel. Give it two or three years to begin to soften.",92,90.0
1303,Louis Latour,"Not for the fainthearted, this is a huge, mouthfilling wine bursting with yellow plum, hazelnut and peach aromas, and accented by smoke, butter and toast. Yet for all its size, it manages to marry that power with a sense of mineral elegance. Drink now–2010.",92,220.0
1304,Casa Santos Lima,"Bitter chocolate and dried apricots vie with each other in this curious wine. It is certainly too big and rich for its own good, a blockbuster of a wine, but without the complexity that could compensate. What is here are very ripe plums, and a layer of dry, bitter tannins.",84,14.0
1305,Albert Bichot,"This wine is ripe, with a warm, yellow fruit character. It is bright and poised, elegant and sophisticated. Acidity shoots through the richness, bringing a strong citrus element. Sunny in character, it will still age; drink from late 2016.",92,23.0
1306,Georges Duboeuf,"With noticeable wood flavors, this sophisticated wine is smooth, rich and creamy. It has enough fruit to sustain all this toast, giving a wine that has a fresh line that runs right through it, passing apples and fresh apricots on the way. Drink from 2016.",92,40.0
1307,Georges Duboeuf,"There is a layer of tannins here that impart a dry edge to what is otherwise sweetly fruity wine. It is full and juicy, with strawberry fruit flavors.",84,10.0
1308,Testarossa,"While Testarossa specializes in single-vineyard wines, this basic appellation blend is solid. It's crisp in acidity and amply oaked, with powerful pineapple and peach jam, buttered toast and sweet vanilla flavors. This wine calls for dramatic Chardonnay fare, such as lobster and crab.",91,34.0
1309,Testarossa,"This wine is opulent with flavors of orange, peach, mangoes and oak, with excellent acidity. Open now and pair with lobster, crab, scallops or tuna.",91,41.0
1310,Undurraga,"Firm cherry and plum aromas filter into a bright, elegant, lifted palate with freshening acidity and body to match. Juicy, lightly spiced core flavors of plum and red currant are draped with a fine oak flavor, and the finish is light, dry, focused and shows modest residual barrel notes.",91,26.0
1311,Testarossa,"This wine shows everything that Chardonnay lovers want. It's enormously rich and ripe in mango, pineapple, orange and peach flavors, enriched with sweet new oak and creamy lees. Drink now.",91,41.0
1312,Columbia Crest,"A 100% varietal wine coming from Block 14 of this up-and-coming vineyard, it has a lot of appeal with notes of dark-brewed coffee, chocolate, cherries and black raspberries. Aged 18 months in half new French oak, it's silky, soft, and supple, showing a lot of polish and restraint.",91,30.0
1313,Gary Farrell,"New oak and ripe tropical fruit, peach and nectarine flavors mark this Chardonnay that is composed of fruit coming from a mix of vineyards in a warmer part of the Russian River Valley. Its zesty acidity gives it brightness, while barrel notes bring a creamy, yeasty complexity. Drink now.",91,50.0
1314,Gary Farrell,"This Chardonnay is extremely close in style and complexity to Gary Farrell's best single-vineyard bottlings, for a lower price. The wine is mouthwatering in acidity, with rich tropical fruit, peach and lime flavors.",91,35.0
1315,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Aromas of toast, yellow apple, corn silk and whiffs of tropical fruit lead to a restrained, elegant palate with a lightly creamy feel.",89,30.0
1316,Concha y Toro,"Initial aromas of lactic oak and sawdust show on the nose, although with time this wine shows more appealing scents of smoky spice and black fruits. Woody and round in feel, this soft Carmenère offers char, hickory and blackberry flavors in front of a plump finish. Drink now.",89,40.0
1317,Chehalem,"A blend of three estate vineyards, this is all-stainless fermented, tart and tasting more of skin than flesh. Citrus flavors of lemon and grapefruit, firm acidity and a wash of minerality keep it clean and refreshing.",88,22.0
1318,Columbia Crest,"Quite pale in color, this wine offers well-defined aromas of apple, cantaloupe and pear. The palate has a textured feel and brings a pleasing sense of purity along with tart acidity. A winning offering of this seldom-seen variety, it should go particularly well at the dinner table.",89,28.0
1319,Siduri,"California-based Siduri cellared and bottled this wine that was vinified in Oregon. Still young and compact, it nonetheless shows some good flesh on its bones. The tannins pop out a bit, along with red berries and a streak of coffee. Another year of bottle age would be helpful, or give it plenty of aeration.",89,39.0
1320,Gary Farrell,"This flinty Chardonnay shares a full oak expression with a whiff of petrol, suggesting a decant or cellaring until 2016 to fully soften. It offers sublime lemon curd and minerally peach flavor amid tangy acidity and a bright finish. It displays a ying-yang between polish and power.",94,50.0
1321,Williams Selyem,"A pretty, perfumed Pinot Noir, with gorgeous streaks of kir and vibrant blackberry and cherry. It's subtle and structured, with a pronounced layer of earthy forest floor on the finish. With sprinklings of spice, it dazzles from beginning to end.",96,58.0
1322,DFJ Vinhos,"An attractive, fruity blend that brings in a fair number of local and international grapes. The result is a seamless, fruity, soft wine that is ready to drink.",85,9.0
1323,Chehalem,The tart hard fruit is well hidden behind chalky tongue-scraping acids. The wine quickly hits a finish with tough tannins and a residual note of wet paper.,85,50.0
1324,Casa Santos Lima,"Spicy and ripe, it's immediately attractive. Dry tannins are easily balanced by the rich berry fruits and acidity. It's a polished wine, ready to drink now.",87,
1325,DFJ Vinhos,"Alvarinho and Chardonnay are the chosen grapes for this blend. As its name suggests, a salty taste from the ocean spices up the ripe yellow and green plum fruits. It's soft with a fine balance of acidity and a soft honey touch at the end.",87,9.0
1326,Gary Farrell,"Made from one of the vineyard's historic blocks, this is a lush, inviting and complex wine, defined by golden honey apple and nutmeg. The texture is contoured and structured, with the richness of lemon meringue, but the balance is what stands out most. A tang of white pepper flirts on the finish.",95,50.0
1327,Louis Latour,"This wine is ripe and structured, dense with both acidity and minerality. It is rich with yellow and tropical fruits but always cut with lively acidity, making it opulent while fresh. Drink from 2022.",95,430.0
1328,Louis Latour,"This is a blend from several Grand Crus on the Corton hill. It is rich and spicy, with great black fruits and solid tannins. A powerful wine, it's shot through with acidity and black-plum fruits throughout the structure. Drink from 2023.",95,170.0
1329,Louis Latour,"Powerful and complex, this dark wine comes from vines at the heart of appellation, rich and dense. It offers the potential of great fruit, rich acidity and considerable structure, and will develop giving richness and long aging. Drink from 2023.",95,350.0
1330,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"Wood aged for 12 months, this dense and structured wine comes from a small parcel of vines in the Clos de Vougeot. It is perfumed, ripe with a solid series of tannins as well as red-berry fruits. The acidity is typical of the vintage, and, along with the tannins, will allow this powerful wine to age well. Drink from 2022.",94,301.0
1331,Louis Latour,"From three different parcels in this large Grand Cru vineyard, this wine is dense and concentrated. Powerful tannins will develop into rich fruits with great intensity. This wine, with its weight, needs time. Drink from 2023.",94,330.0
1332,Louis Latour,"Intense and concentrated, this offers ripe yellow fruits, rich apples and a tight mineral texture. It has power, reinforced by subtle wood aging. A flagship for this producer, the wine will age well. Drink from 2020.",94,175.0
1333,Wines & Winemakers,"This oak-aged wine is intense, rich and packed with black fruits. It has spice from the wood as well as from the Syrah in the blend, while the juicy ripe character comes from Alicante Bouschet. It's an impressive concentrated wine that will be best from 2018.",91,18.0
1334,Undurraga,"On the nose, this Cabernet-led blend deals telltale Chilean aromas of herbs, pepper, spice, berry, tomato and forest floor. Derivative of a cool year, the palate feels tight, with snapping acidity. Hard-hitting acid-driven flavors of spiced berry and black currant finish dark, toasty and oaky, but pulling. Drink through 2025.",91,70.0
1335,V. Sattui,"A big, brawny version of the variety, this is tight and tannic, steeped in leather pouch, black pepper and garrigue. Swirl around in the bottle or glass before sipping, or pair it with braised, leathery meats. A core of acidity helps lift the finish.",88,36.0
1336,Fess Parker,"This wine's light and refreshing nose cuts between orange-blossom ripeness, lime-juice sharpness, chalky minerality and a touch of milk fat. There is good energy on the palate, powered by tart green apple rinds and citrus zest.",88,19.0
1337,Bründlmayer,"Restraint on nose and palate gently leads to citrussy concentration. This is a classy, concentrated selection, with a backbone of fine acidity and very fine, persistent bubbles—both are the must-have attributes of a good apéritif. The long, dry finish will impress those in the know.",91,22.0
1338,Concha y Toro,"Aromas of olive, mushroom and berry fruits are lightly herbal. This Cabernet feels scratchy, abrupt and edgy, while herbal raspberry and plum flavors finish solid and with a slight note of pickle.",87,18.0
1339,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Baking spice and vanilla aromas are at the fore, followed by blue fruit and barrel spices. The barrel influence (71% new French and American) leads on the palate as well, with abundant vanilla flavors that wash over the fruit. There's some good fruit underneath, if you can get to it.",87,30.0
1340,Testarossa,"A touch of campfire smoke invites the nose into this bottling from a historic vineyard. It also offers aromas of dark cranberry, black raspberry, chipped slate and roasting meat. The cran-raspberry element explodes on the generous palate, backed by that familiar smoke, which is laced throughout this wine.",92,64.0
1341,Gary Farrell,"Dry and silky, this shows classic Russian River flavors of red cherries, red currants, cranberries, cola and pomegranates, with plenty of savory spices. The tannins are currently very strong; there will certainly be development over the next 5–6 years.",90,50.0
1342,Foxen,"A beautiful Pinot, authoritative and masculine, with firm tannins, hard acidity and a bone-dry finish. The core of black cherries, cola, spices and sweet oak is irresistibly good. Compelling now right out of the bottle, and should develop over the next six years.",93,56.0
1343,Robert Mondavi,"Fumé Blanc is just another name for Sauvignon Blanc, and this is a delicious one. Dry and racy in acidity, it has deep citrus, tropical fruit and gooseberry flavors. At this price, it's one of the best Sauvignon Blancs on the market. Relatively easy to find, with more than 30,000 cases produced.",90,19.0
1344,Iron Horse,"A savory sparkling wine, rich in raspberry, lime and vanilla flavors. Mainly Pinot Noir, with some Chardonnay, it's full bodied and somewhat sweet.",87,34.0
1345,Williams Selyem,"High alcohol of 20% makes this dessert wine hot in the mouth. That's the main impression, because the sweetness and fruit aren't quite strong enough to balance the heat. Nonetheless it's pretty sweet, with blackberry jam and chocolate flavors.",87,40.0
1346,Lynmar,"This sugary-sweet dessert Chardonnay tries hard to please, offering waves of honey, tangerine, mango and vanilla flavors. It's tantalizingly delicious, but could be just a tad more concentrated, especially at this price.",88,50.0
1347,Montes,"Montes' first Alpha Malbec is serious and healthy, with rubbery, leathery berry aromas and crusty, dark oak scents. This is full and fairly oaky on the tongue, with herbal black-fruit flavors, raw wood notes, espresso-like bitterness and heat on the finish.",88,25.0
1348,Williams Selyem,"A little heavy and syrupy, especially for Williams Selyem, but it's utterly delicious in blackberry jam and root beer flavors that finish soft and sweet, yet tart. Very easy to polish off the whole bottle over a great steak.",88,39.0
1349,Undurraga,"An almost neutral nose offers mild green herb and citrus aromas but little more. The palate is zesty, tangy and fresh, while a narrow set of lemon-lime, grapefruit and lime flavors ends with focused crispness. For something tight and refreshing, this is it.",88,16.0
1350,Fess Parker,"Distinct aromas of sour plum and dried pomegranate meet with damp tobacco, forest floor, green olive and Greek spice on the nose of this clonal study. It's herbal on the palate, with oregano, marjoram and green cardamom notes, alongside cranberry and red cherry fruit in the midpalate. Altogether, it's a light, bright and highly seasoned wine.",92,55.0
1351,Casa Santos Lima,"Six months in a mix of French and Portuguese oak has given this wine a rich, smooth character. Produced from a field blend of more than 40 different varieties, the wine is stylishly structured and ripe with blackberry fruits. It is still young and although it is drinkable now, it will be better from 2017.",91,26.0
1352,Undurraga,"This is largely neutral on the nose except for lazy flowery, tropical aromas. Fairly bold in size and mouthfeel, it has honeyed flavors of nectarine and peach. On the finish, it's more bitter than fresh as the fruit character breaks down.",85,17.0
1353,Wines & Winemakers,"The blend of Fernão Pires and Arinto produces a rich and creamy wine with pear, ripe apple and apricot flavors. A floral character gives extra piquancy.",87,12.0
1354,Kendall-Jackson,"KJ's Mendocino County Zin has both red and black berry fruit flavor and the spiciness one expects from dry-farmed Mendocino County vineyards, though the tannins stick around a bit longer than one might like. Cedar definitely shows up on the finish.",87,16.0
1355,Wines & Winemakers,"A superior Vinho Verde, elegant and full-bodied. The creamy texture is partnered with ripe apricot and pear fruits, a touch of green plum and a feeling of opulence along with the acidity. Drink now, or age a year.",91,19.0
1356,Chehalem,"This crisp, refreshing and all-stainless Chardonnay represents exceptional value. Bright, fresh fruit flavors mix apples, pears and ripe citrus. It's full-bodied and delivers plenty of mouth-filling richness without resorting to barrel aging for support.",91,19.0
1357,Trapiche,"Melon and stone-fruit aromas are minerally and mild, with no overt fruit or oaky aromas sticking out. Crisp, citric and still a touch oily in feel, this tastes of briny citrus fruits, popcorn and salt. On the finish, this shows good body along with lasting salty citrus flavors.",87,25.0
1358,Maryhill,"This wine is a blend of McKinley Springs and Alder Ridge fruit. Coffee and cherry aromas lead to restrained cranberry flavors, with the tannins bringing some dryness and grit.",87,36.0
1359,Bründlmayer,"There is a firm, dry core to this attractively spiced wine. Blackberry fruit is fleshy, ripe, although with a considerable amount of acidity. It's a wine that is structured, finishing with chewy plum skin flavors.",87,
1360,Foxen,"Enormously ripe, with pineapple, lime, tangerine and green apple flavors that show the dry heat of this eastern part of the Santa Ynez Valley. The acidity tastes added on, but welcome, providing savory relief to the richness.",87,26.0
1361,DFJ Vinhos,This is a ripe and juicy blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Tinta Roriz. The tannins are present although well integrated into the fine juicy red-fruit flavors. The wine is ready to drink.,87,9.0
1362,Kunde,"This bottling by fine producer Kunde always shows a grassy, hay-like note to the citrus fruit flavors, so if that's your style, you'll like it. The wine itself is only lightly oaked, and feels crisp and clean in the mouth, as well as dry. The low alcohol is a pleasure.",87,15.0
1363,Robert Mondavi,"Here's a good, sound Merlot that's fancy enough to serve with special fare. It's dry and rich in tannins, with oak-inspired black cherry, currant and pepper flavors. Easy to find, with 29,000 cases produced. The alcohol measures 16%.",87,23.0
1364,Casa Santos Lima,"An unusual blend of Touriga Nacional and Petit Verdot, this wine does in fact work. Tannins, perfume and a dense, dark color give weight and concentration. It is a powerful wine with a future. Drink from 2019.",90,25.0
1365,Chehalem,"With its mix of citrus, stone and tropical fruits, this appealing wine is just a touch past bone-dry. Sourced entirely from estate vineyards, it's supported by just the right amount of acidity. Drink through 2020.",90,20.0
1366,Columbia Crest,"Aromas of plum, stewed cherry, milk chocolate and vanilla are accented by notes of smoke. Fruit and barrel flavors intertwine on the palate, with fruit winning out on the finish that narrows a bit.",87,15.0
1367,Santa Ema,"Herbal and loaded with tomato leaf on the nose, but that's mostly the first impression. The wine settles down to reveal black olive, berry and leather. The feel is smooth and silky, with nice tannins and flavors of herbs, vanilla, cream, plum and chocolate. Lengthy on the finish, with acidic snap throughout. Drink now through 2014.",89,84.0
1368,Trapiche,"Fairly large, dark and extracted, but also lush and rich, with aromas of raisin and stewed blackberry. The palate is rich to the point of almost being heavy, while the flavors of blackberry and roasted black plum are mildly leathery and salty. Nice, big, meaty and tasty for the price.",88,12.0
1369,Maryhill,"Pinot Gris can often show a little bit of a tawny blush, as it's a fairly dark-skinned white grape, but this is downright coppery, like a French Rosé. It's closer to an Oregon style than to other Washington Pinot Gris, with fleshy pear-flavored fruit and light hints of cinnamon and baking spices. Gets off to a good start, then falls away quite rapidly into a quick, generic finish.",86,16.0
1370,Maryhill,"This is a pleasantly fruity wine, with tangy cherry fruit limned with some herbal, earthy tannins. Hints of tobacco and vanilla are there, but the wine quickly shows rather harsh, chalky acids that descend into a bitter, herbal finish.",85,30.0
1371,Maryhill,"For a $15 Washington Merlot, this offers fair value. Despite the earthy, slightly stemmy tannins, the wine has substantial fruit flavors of cranberry and pie cherry, and the acids give it some extra lift. This will go well with fatty meats and grilled steaks.",85,15.0
1372,Testarossa,"A nose of baked apple and saline minerality introduce this wine from this single-vineyard superstar winery. The palate picks up with zing, offering apple candy, lemon lime soda and a bit of bitter tension as well. The wine evolves steadily while on the tongue and is never boring.",92,45.0
1373,Testarossa,"Testarossa's single-vineyard expertise shines on this wine from Rosella's, which is fresh and alive on the nose with ripe nectarine and grapefruit peel. The acidity carries prominently on the palate, but the ruby-red grapefruit elements are not sharp, possessing both sweet and savory sides and finishing with some bitterness. Serve with honey-glazed seared scallops.",92,45.0
1374,Williams Selyem,"This is a Pinot Noir of considerable force. Your first impression is of irrepressible power, with masses of fruit punching through an overlay of tannin and oak. Then the flavors fantail out, suggesting cherries, cola, currants and spices that are rich and complex through the long finish. For all its richness, the wine retains an agreeable delicacy of texture. Comprised of lots selected by winemaker Bob Cabral for this anniversary bottling, it's right up there with Williams Selyem's best 2010 Pinots, and just as ageable. Drink now–2022. The wine is only available as part of a two-pack from the winery for $250; the other bottle is the 2010 Morning Dew Ranch Pinot Noir, from Anderson Valley.",97,125.0
1375,Testarossa,"A gorgeous Chardonnay, flamboyant in tropical fruit, honey, cream and buttered toast, but so balanced in acids and minerals, so clean and pure, that it ventures into truly classic territory. The vineyard long has been a special one for Talley. Now, Testarossa gets to dip in, with fantastic results. One of the best Chardonnays Testarossa has ever produced.",95,39.0
1376,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"The creamy, rich notes of freshly baked pear tart reach the senses first. Next the palate offers a soft, gentle and almost breezy freshness with citrus peel, floral overtones, creamy hints of shortbread and something primal like rock and stone. All of this is held together in a tableau of freshness, poise and elegance. The dry and lasting finish hints at riches to come, and this lovely wine will develop further. Drink now until 2030.",93,60.0
1377,Siduri,"Pressed boysenberry aromas highlight simultaneously dark and fresh fruit on the nose of this bottling by Adam Lee, which also conveys Earl Grey tea, lavender, hibiscus and crushed pencils. The palate picks up the same tack, offering delicate fruits and florals, from cranberry to elderflower.",93,60.0
1378,Testarossa,"This is a dynamic wine, showing Key lime, yellow apples, oak smoke, butter, tangerine pith, macadamia nut and sea salt on the nose. The palate is streamlined with lime pith, lemon rind and seared pineapple flavors.",93,48.0
1379,Testarossa,"There's a fascinating presence of herb-roasted chicken to the well-balanced nose of this Chardonnay from the historic Brousseay Vineyard, alongside chalky minerality, golden apple and Asian pear. Once sipped, it's very easy on the palate, with baked apple, wet stone, slight kiwi and a noticeable salinity.",91,45.0
1380,Louis Latour,"While this wine demonstrates the telltale cool element of the appellation, it also offers ripe fruit, pear and peach flavors lightly layered with wood. The wine is crisp at the end, with a mineral aftertaste. Drink from 2016.",91,45.0
1381,Louis Latour,"Ripe and structured, it has the weight and broad feel of a Chassagne-Montrachet. Firmly textured and concentrated, it also shows soft fruitiness. The power will keep it aging well, so drink from 2017.",91,75.0
1382,Albert Bichot,"Close to the white grand crus of Chassagne-Montrachet, this wine is structured and weighty, and it offers juicy apricot and pear flavors. A citrus element cuts through the wood influence and the steely texture, which brings freshness to the ripe, rich mouthfeel.",92,
1383,Wines & Winemakers,"A powerful and concentrated wine, this shows the region's dark and tannic side. The black plum and juicy black-currant flavors shine, and wood aging has smoothed the palate, which makes it feel dense and fully mature.",92,15.0
1384,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Dark berry, Asian spice and blue flower aromas slowly unfold on this structured red. The full-bodied, tightly wound palate offers up mature black cherry, blackberry, licorice, cinnamon and tobacco while youthfully assertive but refined tannins provide support. Drink 2018–2028.",91,38.0
1385,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"With residual sugar measuring 17 g/L, this puts the emphasis on fruit flavors that are forward, round, ripe and slightly sweet. It's right down the heart of the plate in terms of Washington styles; apple and peach the main flavors.",88,10.0
1386,Concha y Toro,"Concentrated blackberry, leather and loam aromas are big, bold and bullish. This is saturated and heavy in the mouth, with leather, roasted berry and meaty flavors. A round finish comes with just enough snappy acidity to keep it lively, although there is some choppiness and grit to it.",88,26.0
1387,Undurraga,"Roasted berry and cassis aromas are basic and familiar. The palate on this varietal Cabernet is grabby yet solid, with sweet, baked flavors of cassis, berry and chocolate. Hints of toast and darkness rise up on what amounts to a rubbery feeling finish.",88,13.0
1388,Robert Mondavi,"Lots of elegance in this Cabernet. It's dry, full bodied and rich in tannins, with a good depth of black currants and sweet, toasty oak. Won't age, but who cares: Pop the cork and drink it now.",89,28.0
1389,Trapiche,"Full berry aromas are fresh but come with a lot of oak and spice. In the mouth, this Syrah (with 3% Viognier) is chewy and a bit syrupy, with minty, spicy flavors derived from loud oak. On the finish, it dries out and turns warm-to-hot as it fades away. A joint-venture wine between Trapiche and Joey Tensley of California.",89,50.0
1390,Fess Parker,"Run, don't walk, to get this wine. It's wildly good for the price, offering powerful yet controlled black cherry, tea, bacon and black pepper flavors that are wrapped into smooth tannins. Production was 2,061 cases.",92,22.0
1391,Montes,"A blast of passion fruit is accompanied by mango and lettuce scents on a lean nose. This wine is citric and lemony in the mouth, with tangerine and lemon-lime flavors boosted by scouring acidity. The wine is one-dimensionally lean and tangy throughout.",85,16.0
1392,Casa Santos Lima,"This wine is all fruit, ripe and full in the mouth. Touches of wood aging have given an extra dimension to the berry fruits and bright acidity. It's ready to drink.",85,
1393,Casa Santos Lima,"This is a light, fruity wine with fresh red berry flavors and soft tannins. It has a cool feel from the nearby Atlantic Ocean, giving a bright, character and a wine that's ready to drink.",85,10.0
1394,Kendall-Jackson,"It should be easy to drink this sweetish Merlot with everything from a hamburger to a steak. It's rich in cherry flavor, with lots of palate-stimulating spices.",86,19.0
1395,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"This is pure Cabernet from one of Washington's oldest vineyards. Cold Creek is a hot site, and its grapes are scattered throughout many of the Ste. Michelle brands, often providing the core fruit. Here is the essence, a wine that opens a bit grudgingly, but has structure and concentration if you take the time to let it blossom. Dense cherry and cassis fruit is tightly wound with balancing acids. The use of new oak is restrained, but sufficient, and this is a wine that should age nicely for many years.",91,26.0
1396,Bründlmayer,"Soft and finely perfumed, this is full-bodied Riesling, adding just a touch of sweetness to the pear and white currant fruit flavors. This is a great vintage of this wine, probably the best since 2002.",91,30.0
1397,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"The aromas bring spicy notes of cayenne pepper, along with notes of dark-roasted coffee, wood spice and cherry. The palate is full of polished yet voluptuous dark-fruit flavors that are backed by lightly grainy tannins.",90,28.0
1398,Concha y Toro,"Complexity on the nose comes via earthy aromas of licorice root, sandalwood and mild berry fruits. The palate is on the big and bullish side, but it's neither heavy nor fierce. Flavors of ripe blackberry, pepper and chocolate finish with a touch of herbs and mint. Drink through 2017.",90,22.0

1411,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"Subtle notions of ripe peach circle above a compact, bundled palate of peach and spice: perhaps vanilla, perhaps pepper. The distinct but subtle sweetness on the palate is countered by a firm, focussed freshness which in turn contrasts with pleasant warmth. The dramatic palate draws you so far into its quicksand-like depth that you almost forget to notice the more ethereal, scented clouds of peach. Pure joy.",94,65.0
1412,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"The aromatics take time to come to the fore but they are definitely there: notes of lifted Poire William and ripe, golden-cheeked apricots are hinted at. The medium-sweet palate brings them out in full force, glowing with a ripe opulence tempered by freshness and a slight phenolic grip. There is a luminous quality to this wine, shining its way ahead into the future, guided by a seam of freshness and focus on the midpalate, echoing with bitter almond and more fruit. Drink 2016–2026.",94,90.0

1420,DFJ Vinhos,"DFJ is one of a few producers who grow Caladoc, which is here blended with Tinta Roriz.

1425,Siduri,"Evoking the richness and slightly tart deliciousness of a strawberry-rhubarb compote, this is a bright, vibrant and chewy Pinot, its dry tannins peaking on the finish.

1429,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"This surprisingly dry wine has more to do with spice than richness. That gives it a food friendly character full of ripe fruit, a spicy, peppery edge and baked apple flavors. Acidity cuts through providing balance. Drink from the end of 2015.",88,26.0
1430,Trapiche,"The best of the 2008 batch of Trapiche single-vineyard Malbecs is this one from Jorge Miralles' vineyard.

Lovely to drink now, and it should develop bottle complexities over the next 8–10 years.",93,75.0
1450,Gary Farrell,"This is currently very dry and austere due to its tannins, but it's impressive for its noble structure and deep, complex flavors of blackberries, cranberries, brown sugar and spices.- With such depth and a long finish, it's clearly a cellar candidate. Don't even think about opening it until 2017, at least.",93,65.0
1451,Williams Selyem,"Rich, balanced and full bodied, this shows exuberantly ripe, sweet flavors of blackberries, mulberries, dark chocolate and raisins, with notes of exotic spices. It will last for 20 years, gradually losing fruit and growing earthy and mushroomy.",93,50.0

It's easily the most powerful of Lynmar's new Pinots, with deep, brooding cherry and red currant flavors that have been concentrated to syrupy intensity like a boiled-down fruit-wine sauce.

1462,DFJ Vinhos,"This pure Shiraz gives a wonderfully perfumed wine that is both spicy and packed with dark, dense fruits. Blackberries are supported by soft tannins and a touch of caramel from wood aging. It's solid, firm while also fruity and should age. Drink from 2016.",91,13.0
1463,Kunde,"Sanguine, high-toned red fruit features prominently in this almost-equal blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah. Dusty tannin and a relatively light-bodied texture belie the power lurking beneath, the finish a hit of Red Hots and cherry cola.",90,28.0

1466,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Rubrato is a distinctive Aglianico with deeply etched mineral tones backed by hard cherry candy, leather, espresso, toast and loads of mineral shadings. The oak tones are present, but well-integrated and the wine boasts polished, silky tannins.",87,21.0
1467,Feudi di San Gregorio,"There's a very attractive ashen quality to this wine that sits like a veil over a base of stone fruit, honey and pear. The mineral notes come from Campania's rich volcanic soils and this Falanghina does a great job of portraying the variety.",87,20.0

1476,Kendall-Jackson,"A new, Aussie-style line from K-J, a series of varietal blends. This wine is a little too stewed and overripe, with raisiny, pruny aromas and flavors. The finish is a bit jammy and treacly, but it's not a bad casual sipper. —S.H.",83,9.0

1508,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"An astonishing nose of peach and bramble with refreshing accents of lemon zest. The intense, off-dry palate of pistachio, pecan and apricot lead to a long, minerally finish. Carries its hefty 15.5% alcohol well. Best now to 2016.",92,50.0
1509,Chehalem,"Very consistent in style with previous vintages, this textural, lemony, racy Riesling seems bone dry, though it is noted as having 1% residual sugar. Along with rich flavors of grapefruit and citrus, there are nectarine and pear fruit highlights and a sharp minerality.",92,24.0
1510,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"Profound enough for serious contemplation but with enough broad fruit appeal to serve to a crowd. There's loads of upfront Asian spice and lychee, afloat on a luxurious, sensually textured palate. Notes of geranium and macadamia nuts keep the taste buds entertained and carry over to the lingering finish. The noticeable residual sugar suggests pairing with something slightly sweet, like Tilapia in a mango salsa. Drink now to 2011.",92,48.0
1511,Maryhill,"This wine is a blend of Art Den Hoed Petite Sirah (80%) and Gunkel Vineyard Zinfandel. Aromas of barrel spice, vanilla, raspberry and purple fruit are followed by full-bodied palate-coating fruit flavors, brightened by fresh acidity. The interest is as much about feel as flavor.",91,36.0
1512,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"A tightly wrought, crisp texture gives the typical cool character of this appellation. This wine is full of white fruits layered with juicy acidity. Full in the mouth, it is delicious to drink although it will be better from 2017.",90,38.0
1513,Kunde,"Strawberry and red currant complement deeper, more savory aspects of cedar and gun smoke in this thick, full-bodied and concentrated reserve-level wine, accented in bitter, black tea.",88,60.0
1514,Williams Selyem,"Intriguing aromas of dried herbs give nuance to the heartier bourbon barrel, cherry candy and caramel aromas on the nose of this bottling of traditional Portuguese varieties Touriga Nacional, Tinta Cão, Tinta Francesca and Tinta Madeira. Caramelized black cherries and blueberries mesh with peppercorns and asphalt on the palate, which is expressive and nuanced for such a powerful style.",91,40.0
1515,Georges Duboeuf,"More tannic structure than fruit at this stage, this is a firm, mineral-textured wine. A smoky, spicy character gives complexity, but also is still masks the red-currant fruits. Drink from 2016.",87,20.0
1516,Georges Duboeuf,"While this wine does have structure, it also offers some lean fruitiness. Plum skins, banana and tight black-currant flavors dominate, cut through with acidity. The wine has structure and some potential. Drink from late 2016.",87,
1517,Williams Selyem,"Woody, herbal and resplendent in forest-floor pine and sandalwood, this is a complex, earthy and medium-bodied wine. It's low in oak, and revelatory in cool-climate seductions of pomegranate, cranberry and rhubarb compote. The finish is all black tea, with still-developing tannin structure and power.",95,58.0
1518,Williams Selyem,"From the hillsides of Westside Road, a goldmine of goodness, this estate-driven wine is packed with cinnamon, black-cherry clafouti and crushed rose petals. Soft and seductively silky on the palate, it's bright and deceptively light, a symphony of pomegranate, cardamon and blood orange that lingers on the finish.",95,105.0
1519,Wines & Winemakers,"A ripe and creamy blend of Fernão Pires and Arinto, this is both fresh and richly textured. It has weight as well as a smooth texture, full in the mouth while also tangy. Already delicious, it will also age, so drink until 2018.",88,11.0
1520,Iron Horse,"This one-time-only blanc de blancs is made from a Stony Hill Chardonnay clone planted in a single block of the producer's vineyard—since planted to Pinot Noir. This sparkler is sublime, the mousse silky and speckled in minerality. Lemon, pear and brine combine to good effect on the palate, buoying the exuberant fragrances of orange peel and cream pie.",94,62.0
1521,Lynmar,"This is an outright steal for a wine of this quality, a remarkable entry into the producer's wider world of knockout designates. Lush and layered, it combines decadent cherry, vanilla and spicy cinnamon-cola over an elegant, medium-bodied structure.",94,40.0
1522,Bründlmayer,"Ripe yellow pear notes signal a richness that is subsumed on the palate into a salty, zingy, lemon-zest savoriness. Sprays of white pepper flare deliciously at every turn while notes of the freshly cut peel of ripe lemons illuminate everything. A very compelling wine with lots of friendly personality. Utterly moreish.",94,69.0
1523,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Cabernet Sauvignon makes up 73% of this wine, along with 20% Merlot, 5% Malbec and 2% Cabernet Franc. Tightly wound aromas of wood spice, vanilla, black fruit, plum and coffee bean give way to full-bodied, palate-coating and concentrated cherry and espresso flavors that linger on the finish. The barrel influence is heavy, but it works.",91,65.0
1524,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,This rich and full-bodied wine brings out the structure of a Chassagne premier cru. It has generous fruits and a toasty structure. Drink from 2017.,88,143.0
1525,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"This structured wine also has bright red fruits and juicy acidity. It's an attractive bottle now, the tannins showing through while leaving room for an elegant, leisurely aftertaste. Drink from 2015.",88,
1526,Louis Latour,"This is one of the higher elevation premier crus in Puligny. In this warm vintage it has managed to give a wine that is crisp and mineral. To contrast with this, the wine also has a creamy, toasty character from the wood aging. Drink from 2021.",93,90.0
1527,Robert Mondavi,"A little simple in citrus flavor, but for the price, a pretty nice wine. It's the kind of crisp, dry white I've had many times at gallery openings and such, inexpensive, but with enough panache to satisfy a picky crowd.",85,11.0
1528,Wines & Winemakers,"A light fragrant blend of Touriga Nacional and Tinta Cão, the wine is soft with plenty of strawberry fruitiness and acidity. The aftertaste has a great lift of perfumed crispness.",86,20.0
1529,Columbia Crest,"This wine shows unusually prominent aromas and flavors of dried rice that are followed by wilted flowers, dried leaves, cocoa and dark fruit. It doesn't all come together.",85,35.0
1530,Trapiche,"Trapiche's Broquel is definitely one of Argentina's most consistent Bonardas. It opens with balsamic notes that accent chocolate and blackberry aromas, while the palate is sweet and steady as it delivers plum and ripe berry flavors. Good structure and feel, with just enough acidity to keep it in balance.",88,17.0
1531,Louis Latour,"Densely tannic and firm, this wine has fresh acidity and red-plum-skin flavors. It is a solid, chunky wine, likely to age well, with a vibrant, juicy freshness in the aftertaste.",88,30.0
1532,Louis Jadot,"This is a beautiful wine with elegant fruits that reflect a strong sense of minerality. It is crisp, although that is just a surface quality to a wine that has such depth. Toast flavors round out the intense fruits, giving a light spice and butter to this powerful wine. Drink from 2020.",97,476.0
1533,Louis Jadot,"With its great richness, the wine is opulent, generous and full of powerful fruits. The wood aging and the toastiness have done nothing to diminish the yellow fruit and crisp apple flavors. It's an impressive and concentrated wine that will age for many years. Drink from 2020.",96,370.0
1534,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"Fulsome notes of ripe, juicy pear lead straight to a fluid, concentrated palate that holds a whole world of ripe pear flavors. This is still deep in its shell, ringing with primary fruit but burying many layers of spiced joy: think marzipan and gingerbread. This is one for laying down that will reward patient drinkers. The deep core of fruit, the concentration on the midpalate and the ultraclean finish all suggest a great future. Drink 2018–2028.",94,105.0
1535,Gary Farrell,"Sleek and elegant, showing a great sense of control, the cherry and currant fruits are strong, yet restrained, pulled in by crisp acidity and taut tannins. It should develop over the next six years or so.",91,55.0
1536,V. Sattui,"Generous in toasty barrel characteristics of smoky oak and apple crisp, crème brûlée and caramel, this is true to its 100% barrel fermentation and big-boned style.",85,30.0
1537,Concha y Toro,"Potent black-fruit aromas are forward. In the mouth, this is choppy and punchy. Flavors of mint, coconut and jagged black fruits finish oaky and grabby, with tartness. There are many disparate parts to this wine.",85,18.0
1538,Concha y Toro,"Ripe aromas of melon are flabby. This is both chunky yet citrusy in feel, while flavors of orange and lemon are basic. The finish is soft but shows just enough citric acidity to keep things going.",85,15.0
1539,Concha y Toro,"Dusty fruit and chemical/plastic aromas are a little off-putting. This feels tight and shows moderate snappy tartaric acid. Flavors of mint, herbs and spiced plum are fair for the variety but green.",85,11.0
1540,Santa Ema,"Rubber and earth aromas lead to a mix of berry fruit scents and a pinch of vinegar. It's firm in the mouth, with cranberry and herbal raspberry flavors. Gives about as much as it can but at the same time it shows a tart, basic, mildly herbal DNA.",84,10.0
1541,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"A sweet wine, but lively, touched by honey, its acidity coming through as delicious final fruit and spice.",90,55.0
1542,Kendall-Jackson,"Kendall-Jackson helped define the buttery oaky Chardonnay movement, and this bottling plays that card quite strongly. Oak meets with roasted nuts, sea salt, pecan brittle and Gravenstein apple on the nose. The rounded palate shows sandalwood, candied walnuts and chamomile, though oak is very prominent as well.",88,35.0
1543,Louis Latour,This is ripe and fruity with attractive red-fruit flavors and a touch of tannins to keep it all in place. The wine is soft with just a layer of tannin and plenty of red cherries at the end.,88,28.0
1544,Maryhill,"This wine is brightly aromatic, with raspberry, mint, herb and woodspice notes. The palate is full of plush, plump fruit flavors that provide appeal, despite the prominent alcohol.",88,40.0
1545,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Delicately perfumed and elegant, this offers scents of jasmine, Spanish broom, beeswax and pear. The aromas follow through to the understated palate along with citrus and mineral. Vibrant acidity provides the framework. Drink 2018 through 2023.",93,60.0
1546,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Citrus, acacia flower, white stone fruit and a whiff of honey are some of the alluring scents you'll find on this vibrant, refined white. The taut, well-structured palate doles out white peach, apricot, honey and hazelnut energized by flinty mineral. Give this a few more years to fully develop. Drink 2018 through 2025.",93,60.0
1547,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Enticing scents of white spring flower, Spanish broom, Mediterranean herb and orchard fruit come together in the glass. On the elegant, full-bodied palate, a mineral vein underscores ripe pear, peach, candied citrus and mineral. Fresh acidity lifts the creamy flavors.",93,31.0
1548,Albert Bichot,"From the southern part of Nuits-Saint-Georges, this small premier cru has produced a dark and structured wine with plenty of dry tannins that need to age. It is concentrated and firm, the tannins backed up by generous black-plum fruits. Drink this wine from 2022.",93,99.0
1549,Albert Bichot,"While this wine has generous swathes of ripe fruit, it also has plenty of the dark tannins that are found in the northern part of the appellation. It is dense in character, packed equally with concentrated tannins and with red-berry fruits. The wine will age well; drink from 2022.",93,140.0
1550,Undurraga,"Hard, rubbery blackberry and black-currant flavors are herbal but settle with airing. This feels round, fresh and fair. Flavors of spiced plum, blackberry, carob and generic spices finish dark and foresty, with good overall balance.",88,17.0
1551,Chanson Père et Fils,"This wine is fresh, crisp with acidity and an attractive zingy character. It has a lift and brightness along with hints of yellow fruits and a touch of spice.",88,25.0
1552,Chanson Père et Fils,"This is a young, perfumed wine with attractive red fruits. While the wood is showing at the moment, that will fade as the wine develops, giving a fresh, raspberry-dominated wine. Drink from 2018.",88,34.0
1553,Chanson Père et Fils,"This wine is ripe, full of yellow fruits that are balanced with crisp acidity. That gives a balanced wine that is juicy, perfumed and rich. The aftertaste is equally attractive, showing lemon-zest flavor.",88,25.0
1554,Fess Parker,"Smoky notes of roasted meat and white pepper spice up the plum skins and blackberry fruit that show on the nose of this bottling. The smoke is also prominent on the sip, where graphite minerality frames the blueberry and blackberry fruit. The character of slightly burnt balsamic reduction sauce also shows through.",88,49.0
1555,Lynmar,"The producer veers off its estate program to tap into the beauty and brawn that is Kanzler, a magnificent site of its own. Raspberry and a touch of vanilla swirl around a darkness of allspice and cola, lifted by bold acidity and a wealth of texture. Full bodied, this wine shows plenty of oak that should become more integrated in time.",93,70.0
1556,Santa Ema,"Nice color and good aromas of berry and plum make this common wine attractive. The palate, while ordinary, is bold, sizable and tastes of boysenberry, spice and pepper. And the finish is mild and concentrated before turning peppery. For a basic Carmenère, Santa Ema has gotten it right.",86,12.0
1557,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"Clos Windsbuhl in Hunawihr is the northernmost of Zind-Humbrecht's collection of vineyards. In 2012, it has produced an impressive wine that has all the right spice of Pinot Gris along with acidity and a fresh edge. That gives this rich wine a great lift, with a waft of pear to go with the yellow-fruit flavors. Drink from 2016.",92,80.0
1558,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"Situated in Turckheim just below the Brand Grand Cru vineyard, Heimbourg is a great vineyard for Gewurztraminer. This wine is dense, rich, poised and balanced. The intense fruitiness is balanced by the structure and a crisp edge to its sweetness. Drink from 2017.",92,60.0
1559,V. Sattui,"An unbalanced wine despite some pretty apple and peach flavors, an overlay of oak, and a creamy smooth texture. The parts are nice but somehow they don't knit together and the wine feels disjointed. Turns quite bitter on the finish.",84,15.0
1560,Williams Selyem,"There is something ethereal and beyond words about this wine, a full-bodied but never intrusive expression of spicy cinnamon, black pepper and wild pine that makes it a puzzle worth trying to solve. Fruit plays a part, though softly, eking out shadows of raspberry and just-picked strawberry atop smooth, silky tannins and a measured, seductive body. The finish recalls a clove cigarette enjoyed in the rain.",98,75.0
1561,Williams Selyem,"Expressive in oak, earth and clove with cinnamon-cola, this savory, complex wine is also impressive in its ability to offer crisp and focused lines of citrus and fresh-picked raspberry. It teeter-totters the variety's ability to be both fruit-forward and elusively hard to reach. Streaks of thyme and rosemary figure into the mix. Drink now through 2023.",97,79.0
1562,Williams Selyem,"A vineyard for both Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, Allen is exquisitely detailed in this textured bottling that's weighty, with a tannin backdrop and replete with savory fruit. Wild strawberry, Bing cherry and black tea stand out, with an undercurrent of lushness that's hard to resist.",96,82.0
1563,Gary Farrell,"The vintage was very kind to Chardonnay, and the balance shows in the fantastically ripe, exotic pineapple tart, lemondrop candy, buttered toast, sandalwood and sweet, dusty spice flavors of this immaculately dry, crisp wine. It's strong and impressive now, and not particularly subtle, but should have a narrow window of near perfection. 2011–2013.",94,41.0
1564,Feudi di San Gregorio,This is a really fantastic white wine from southern Italy that expresses much of the complexity and beauty of the land that shaped it. It also promises a perfect pairing match to any Mediterranean fish dish—from mussels with coarse black pepper or steamed calamari in lemon juice and olive oil.,88,22.0
1565,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"This is a pale-colored wine—lightly fruity and with a crisp clean texture. It is balanced with acidity and orange-zest flavor, giving the wine a refreshing lift at the end. This is an apéritif style, ready to drink now.",86,13.0
1566,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Here's a pearl for sparkling wine lovers. This bubbly rosato is made from the hearty Aglianico grape, usually reserved for one of Italy's most austere and masculine red wines. Yet here the variety shows a delicate, soft side with notes of wild berry and creamy almond paste.",90,43.0
1567,Casa Santos Lima,"From the good winds (Bons Ventos) estate, this balanced wine has good acidity as well as black-currant fruit. Tannins give the wine its dry core and structure. Nine months in wood have added spice and the smooth texture. Drink from 2018.",88,18.0
1568,Casa Santos Lima,A brief period of wood aging delivers soft tannins and juicy blackberry fruits to this ripe wine. A streak of acidity gives the powerful wine a crisp edge. Drink now.,88,15.0
1569,Chehalem,"Only occasionally produced, this reserve-level wine is a bit of a mystery in this new vintage. It's tart and shy, its black fruit laced with assertive acidity and its finish excessively astringent.",88,99.0
1570,Chehalem,"Full, fleshy and flavorful, this blend of the three estate vineyards offers pretty fruit flavors of strawberry and Bing cherry. It carries a whiff of white pepper, along with luscious, orange-tinged acidity.",88,32.0
1571,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"Ripe notions of juicy peach and yellow pear rise from the glass. Around the edges they have an aromatic touch of grapefruit zest. That zesty notion remains a constant fixture on the very rich medium-sweet palate, countering the luscious richness of the fruit which shines with honeyed peach, juicy pear and ripe tangerine. It is the zestiness that frames everything on this rich powerful palate. This is lovely now but it has all the fruit and concentration to age well. Drink 2017–2037.",94,80.0
1572,Fess Parker,"Despite the rich, buttery, toasty oak notes, this wine stands up to the barrel influence with its strong tropical fruit and pear flavors, as well as its brisk acidity and stony minerality. It's ready to drink now with rich fare like lobsters or scallops.",89,35.0
1573,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"This workhorse vineyard supplies grapes to a wide variety of wines across the entire Ste. Michelle portfolio, but the vineyard-designated wines are much more limited, and they're often the best of show. As the alcohol reaches 15.5%, this selection is sappy, dense and a bit warm. There's plenty of fruit flavor and concentration, but it's difficult to pair such a blockbuster with food.",89,28.0
1574,Siduri,"Give this Pinot  Noir a couple of years to knit together. Right now it's a little acidic, and it offers flavors of Life Savers candy, raspberry and cherry. The mouthfeel is velvety smooth.",89,52.0
1575,Albert Bichot,"Rich and broad, this is packed with dense fruit and tannins. It is ripe and full bodied, two qualities that are derived from the warm vineyard. The finish shows juicy acidity.",89,
1576,Santa Ema,"A dark color and rich, jammy, baked aromas of charred oak and lush berries are the opening to this blend of 72% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Carmenère and 8% Cabernet Franc. Moderately bold acidity and firm tannins lend energy and structure to the palate, while this tastes of blackberry, cassis and spicy oak. A slightly hot finish with a lot of wood spice is the closing act. Drink through 2021.",91,50.0
1577,Fess Parker,"Crisp acidity and a cool minerality, like liquid granite, give this wine elegance and complexity. It's rich in tropical fruits, peaches, pears, buttercream and vanilla, with oaky notes of buttered toast and caramel. What a fancy wine to have with Chardonnay-friendly fare, like lobster, crab or scallops in cream sauce.",92,35.0
1578,Testarossa,"This new line from the well-regarded Testarossa Winery is a barrel selection emphasizing richness. The wine floods the mouth with succulent raspberries and cherries, with tarter notes of cranberries and red licorice. Earthiness provides extra complexity, and it could age well through 2020.",91,60.0
1579,Georges Duboeuf,"A fruity, forward wine with a touch of smokiness to go with the red cherry fruits and clear acidity. It's a full wine, structured with its background of tannins. The aftertaste brings out bright fruits.",87,
1580,Louis Jadot,"Bright and vivid, this crisp wine is made without oak. It is all fruitiness, crisp apples and grapefruit, with a tangy orange zest texture. It's ready to drink.",85,15.0
1581,Casa Santos Lima,"Cigarra, a cricket, is common in the Lisboa vineyards. The wine has a good mix of citrus and yellow fruit flavors, crisp and ripe at the same time. An attractive chalky, steely feel comes through in the acidity and the tight, nervy aftertaste.",85,8.0
1582,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"A light-colored wine, this reflects the cool character of the Hautes Côtes. The result is a wine that's stalky, fruity and layered with acidity. It has a lightly strawberry, juicy aftertaste. Drink from 2015.",85,42.0
1583,Louis Jadot,"Very structured, as befits a Vosne-Romanée, even a village wine. The black cherry fruit and layered acidity are combined with a firm and dry tannic core. There is power here, and some aging potential.",92,56.0
1584,Gary Farrell,"From a cool site in the Sebastopol Hills greatly influenced by the cooling fog and winds of the Petaluma Gap, this wine is velvety in texture, with a gritty tannic backbone. Cedar, eucalyptus and savory tea complement an array of juicy red fruit and blueberry, with structure and balance at the wine's core.",93,65.0
1585,Georges Duboeuf,"A rich and rounded wine from a top Beaujolais vintage, this is ripe and full, packed with black cherry flavor and tannins that have now fully integrated into this warm wine. Drink now, although it could age longer.",91,
1586,Robert Mondavi,"Very funky and confounding at first, but then it opens to reveal smoke, stone fruit and mineral aromas. The mouth is quite spicy, with green herbs accenting citrus and mineral. The tangy lemon finish has a chalky grip to it, which only adds to the overall complexity of this unique Napa white.",89,19.0
1587,Louis Latour,"Butter, pain grillé and roasted nut aromas expand on the palate into honey, peach and tangerine flavors, accented by citrus and mineral notes. Spicy (white peppery) on the finish.",89,50.0
1588,Louis Latour,"California comes to Burgundy in this wine, which features aromas of toast, caramel and butterscotch and flavors of buttered baked apples. Lush and obvious; even shows a bit of California-esque heat on the finish.",88,54.0
1589,Robert Mondavi,"Very grassy and citrusy, with hints of garden-fresh vegetables and a slight floral note. It's light and almost airy on the tongue, finishing crisp and clean. A refreshing burst of anise caps things off.",88,23.0
1590,Louis Latour,"This is a big, bold wine with scents of ripe pear and a hint of anise. The fruit seems to grow and add dimension in the mouth, featuring pears and peaches that are topped off with a dollop of spicy oak and butter.",88,47.0
1591,Gary Farrell,"A big, young Pinot Noir that shows brilliant stuffing and complexity, but it's rather heavy and tannic now, and not a wine to open before, say, 2011 at the very least. In its youth it displays rich, jammy flavors of red cherries, raspberries, Dr. Pepper cola, beef jerky and smoky sandalwood, and is very dry. Should evolve slowly through 2015 or beyond.",92,50.0
1592,Lynmar,"The counterpart to Lynn's Blend, named for a co-proprietor, Anisya's showcases the lighter side of the Sonoma Coast in its exuberance of red cherry, orange and strawberry. Textured, it features bright acidity and layers of freshness, teased in black tea and wild truffle.",94,85.0
1593,Lynmar,"This is a bright, integrated and extremely impressive blend of different estate-vineyard sources. Effortlessly enjoyed, it's nonetheless plenty complex underneath the pleasing fruit and acidity. Tart plum, raspberry, pomegranate and touches of cola and mocha combine for a seamless, satisfying experience.",94,45.0
1594,Lynmar,"Bliss Block lies within the property's Quail Hill Vineyard and is the coolest two acres on the estate. Spicy acidity and dark earth support a full-bodied, oaky imprint of complexity and structure, dotted in savory cranberry and black tea.",94,80.0
1595,Lynmar,"This is a truly beautiful wine, a blend of two estate vineyards, Quail Hill and Susanna's. Richly layered and concentrated in its still-vibrant youth, it's also texturally complex and compelling in its teases of ginger and honey, taking on more succulent notions of apple and a flinty element as it opens.",94,55.0
1596,Casa Santos Lima,"With a blend that includes the Encruzado grape better known in the Dão region, this is a full-bodied, wood-aged wine. The acidity contrasts with the toast and ripe yellow and citrus fruits. Drink this wine from late 2017.",88,
1597,Siduri,"Winemaker Adam Lee notes that only two Oregon Pinots were made in 2011, as all fruit was declassified. Indeed, this is a thin, peppery wine, with highlights of orange peel and grapefruit, and just a short slice of red berry fruit.",85,22.0
1598,V. Sattui,"A brooding foundation of blackberry and mushroomy earth lift this full-bodied, tannic wine, which needs further time in bottle to develop. Spicy cinnamon, clove and pepper keep it lively on the palate, between the density and concentration of oak. Let this wine unwind in the bottle through 2020.",88,35.0
1599,Kunde,"Raspberry and vanilla introduce this wine, made from a selection of vines 21 to 130 years old, with some planted in 1882. Lusty and lush layers of cinnamon and cola accent the fruit and provide complexity, the tannins resolved and thick.",88,45.0
1600,Wines & Winemakers,"Fernão Pires with Sauvignon Blanc allows the second grape's herbal nature to shine. So it is crisp, citrusy and with intense acidity. The wine has a ripe feel with hints of tropical fruit at the end. Drink now.",85,15.0
1601,Williams Selyem,"A full-bodied blend from different vineyard sites, this wine celebrates darker, denser aspects of black cherry and cranberry alongside a savory, herbal component that persists on the palate, finished up by a mouthwatering mix of orange and chocolate. Complex and robust in tannin, it needs time to breathe before being enjoyed.",91,52.0
1602,Gary Farrell,"A strong, punchy Pinot Noir, ungainly now for its immaturity, showing tons of jammy raspberries and cherries. The acidity is tart, which is good in a wine this rich, providing balance, and there's also a scour of tannins. All indications suggest cellaring this wine for at least six years.",92,50.0
1603,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Honeysuckle, mineral, honey and botrytis aromas lead the way. This drinks off dry with exceptionally well-balanced acidity that carries through the lingering finish.",90,16.0
1604,Columbia Crest,"Cocoa, plum and vanilla aromas are followed by creamy-feeling blue-fruit flavors that display a mixture of fruit and barrel. The barrel influence is heavy, but it's delicious all the same.",90,12.0
1605,Columbia Crest,"This wine was aged 15 months sur lee in all-new French oak. The barrel aromas and flavors are in the lead, with notes of vanilla, butterscotch and spice followed by pear. It's creamy in feel but with an elegant styling.",90,26.0
1606,Georges Duboeuf,"Ripe red berries and a touch of red plum give this wine a full, fruity character. Light tannins add a suggestion of structure. It's juicy and ready to drink.",84,
1607,Georges Duboeuf,"Tight acidity, cherry flavors and a hint of banana give this wine a light and fruity character. It has probably too much acidity for its own good, making it too crisp, missing out on richness.",84,
1608,Georges Duboeuf,Banana flavors spoil this otherwise attractive and fruity wine. A dry core of tannins is surrounded by creamed banana and red fruits. Drink now.,84,13.0
1609,Kendall-Jackson,"The vintage was a good one for all K-J's Cabernets, and this Grand Reserve offers lots of bang for your buck. It's full-bodied and dry, with rich blackberry jam, red currant, licorice and cedar flavors that finish long and spicy.",91,30.0
1610,Williams Selyem,"This expresses the greatness of its vintage and vineyard, offering wave after wave of raspberry and cherry pie flavors, plus notes of red currant, sweet licorice, spicy Dr. Pepper and smoky sandalwood. There's also something exotically briary and wild that intrigues. Even more remarkable is the texture, an amalgam of acids and tannins that rivals any Pinot Noir ever produced in California. It should age for up to 20 years.",99,75.0
1611,Williams Selyem,"In recent years, Precious Mountain Vineyard has provided Bob Cabral with some of his most glorious fruit. Tremendous in flash and depth, it offers compelling flavors of raspberry and cherry, accented by sweet, smoky oak. There's such complexity in the acid and tannin structure, and in the earthy, stony, spicy nuances, that you find something new to love with every sip. This masterpiece is fabulous now, and will develop bottle complexity over the next 15 years, at least.",98,94.0
1612,Williams Selyem,"This wine shows real first-growth quality in its intensity and concentration, with orange nectar, golden mango, pear, peach pie, buttercream, vanilla, buttered toast and spice flavors. The balance is exquisite, and the way the acids dance along the palate make the wine clean and lively.",97,50.0
1613,Bründlmayer,"Bründlmayer's flagship wine is made from old vines grown on the Heiligenstein hill. It is as intense as a great Riesling can be, a pure expression of steel, mineral and bitter orange and pineapple flavors. It has great structure and a ripe, concentrated character. This will age long and well.",96,78.0
1614,Williams Selyem,"Winemaker Bob Cabral's three 2010 Chardonnays are possibly the greatest he's ever made. This bottling shows fabulous complexity and sheer deliciousness, offering intricate notes of butterscotch, tropical fruit, pear tart, golden apricot, vanilla cream, buttered toast and exotic spice, with perhaps just a trace of honey. Its brilliant acidity and a tangy minerality provide the balance that pushes this wine off the charts.",96,65.0
1615,Williams Selyem,"The acidity really makes this Chardonnay come alive, providing vitality, a quality that's boosted by an undercurrent of minerals. It's so rich in tropical fruit, orange, nectarine and pear flavors, and so generously oaked, which brings a sweet, satisfying note of buttered toast, that all you want to do is drink it now, preferably with steamed lobster and melted butter.",96,50.0
1616,DFJ Vinhos,"Full and ripe, this is a lemon and crisp apple flavored wine. There is a hint of toast from the six months in barrel that also adds a little pepper. Fine acidity and a tangy texture suggests it could age. Drink this wine from 2017.",89,13.0
1617,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"The characteristic 2014 acidity makes a lovely lemony splash in the center of this dry, refreshing wine. Lemon freshness rises from the glass, offering lots of verve and a lip-smacking finish.",89,26.0
1618,Bründlmayer,"Tense, dry wine that brings out all the minerality of the Käferberg Vineyard. This is an impressive, ageworthy wine, dominated at this stage by citrus and green apple flavors. Likely to age over many years with its structure intact.",94,
1619,Bründlmayer,"Intensely rich wine that flows opulently. Rounded warm and concentrated, it has spice, pepper as well as pineapple and peach fruit. It is not sweet but the unctuous character makes it feel so. Needs at least five years in bottle.",94,
1620,Robert Mondavi,"Green bell pepper and gooseberry notes dominate this Sauvignon Blanc, although it does have notes of honey and Meyer lemons. It's bright in acidity, and the finish is spicy and clean. For the price, it's a good value.",85,11.0
1621,Concha y Toro,"Although this presents itself on the bouquet as being a bit soft and mealy, the palate is solid albeit chunky and blocky. Standard citrus and lemon flavors hold onto some tang on the finish. Overall, this is clean and friendly but a bit dull.",85,12.0
1622,Louis Latour,"Warm and ripe, this has yellow fruits that contrast with the freshness of crisp apples. There is a light touch of minerality, although the essence of the wine is its fruitiness.",87,22.0
1623,Georges Duboeuf,"Ripe and wood aged, full bodied and rounded, this is now mature. Its broad features are tempered by a shot of minerality and a steel note that add a crisp texture to the tropical fruits.",87,
1624,Columbia Crest,"Coming from a site across from Cold Creek, this wine offers notes of toast, sautéed herbs, blackberry and spice. It's rich, power packed and layered with dark fruit flavors and firm tannins—an excellent mixture of power and elegance.",92,35.0
1625,Undurraga,"Earthy, rubbery blackberry aromas become more clean and open the longer this sits. Firm tannins create a strong but fair palate, while licorice, mint and spice notes sit on top of generic berry flavors. Weight and heat are noticeable on the finish.",87,13.0
1626,Wines & Winemakers,"A blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Fernão Pires, this crisp, lightly herbaceous wine has a soft texture and attractive, creamy acidity. Hints of yellow fruits come through deliciously at the end.",87,14.0
1627,Undurraga,"Gritty, gaseous aromas are demanding. This SB offers up a citric, pulpy body and slightly bitter flavors of passion fruit, orange and tangerine. Citrus pith and related bitterness blend with citric acidity on the finish, but this wine is starting to fade.",87,20.0
1628,Wines & Winemakers,"This rich, delicious blend of Castelão and Alicante Bouschet is soft and juicy, with black and blue berry flavors, dusty tannins and a fine, jammy aftertaste.",87,11.0
1629,Wines & Winemakers,"Ripe and juicy, maybe a little rustic round the edges, certainly fruity. Red berry flavors dominate along with an edgy center of tannin, while juicy acidity completes this attractive wine.",87,11.0
1630,Robert Mondavi,"Like the label says, this is a bone-dry wine. Laden with flint-infused tropical fruit and yellow apricot flavors brightened with a squirt of lime acidity, the is an especially mouthwatering wine. More than 13,000 cases produced.",89,20.0
1631,Testarossa,"Baked cherry and burned caramel-pie notes meet with brown spices, cranberry, smoked pork and dried anise on the shape-shifting nose of this bottling. The flavors are clean and smoky, with slightly charred cherries, roasted plums, grilled meat and an uplifting sage-eucalytpus finish.",93,64.0
1632,Gary Farrell,"Set within the smaller Green Valley AVA, Hallberg is 100 acres of varying aspects and weather, much of the site impacted by ocean winds and fog. The wine reflects this in its bright, citrusy acidity and earth, measured by elegant layers of orange, cranberry and strawberry. Cedar and black tea give it an exotic edge.",93,60.0
1633,Wines & Winemakers,"An ancient variety now seen rarely, this Códega do Larinho has produced a wine that has a steely texture and tangy citrus flavors. It is bright with acidity, lime and grapefruit fruits and so crisp. It is ready to drink.",88,18.0
1634,Chanson Père et Fils,"Light and fruity, this is an attractive, rounded wine. With its bright acidity, touch of minerality and orange-peel flavor, it is open and ready to drink.",87,32.0
1635,Undurraga,"Briny aromas of oyster shell blend with green onion, lime and matchstick scents on this sulfuric-smelling SB. Tangy and round, with an oily note to the mouthfeel, this tastes of salty lime, tangerine, saline solution and pickle brine.",87,18.0
1636,Undurraga,"This wine's bouquet is peppery, meaty, spicy and altogether honest. The palate feels frisky and juicy, not heavy or flat, then tastes of char, black coffee, cola and spiced, herb-tinged berry. The finish is long, toasty and snappy.",88,16.0
1637,Undurraga,"Toasty, inviting aromas of apple and melon lead to a balanced palate with layered flavors of resiny oak, pear and peach. The finish continues with resin and oak, but by then it has already established itself as a well-balanced wine, with tasty flavors of white and tropical fruit.",88,16.0
1638,Louis Latour,"From a small parcel at the base of the hill of Beaune, this is a delicious wine with a touch of vanilla. It is rounded, smooth and rich, bringing out both fruit and toasty wood flavors that are integrated well. Drink from 2016.",90,40.0
1639,Louis Latour,"Firm in its tannins and with a sense of power, this full-bodied wine has great fruit, along with wood and licorice flavors. This complex and fruity, wine is generous and ready to age. Drink from 2017.",90,85.0
1640,Albert Bichot,"Spicy, rich and concentrated, the important element of acidity working with the ripeness of the juicy black fruits. The wine has density, pushing tannins through to the ripe fruits. It shows a dry element that will take time to integrate.",93,
1641,Chanson Père et Fils,"A dense and serious wine, layering acidity with tight tannins. Under this surface firmness, the red-berry fruit is sumptuous with great juicy freshness. It is a great bringing together of structure, roundness and lively acidity.",93,
1642,Fess Parker,"Pink grapefruit, a linear chalky component and the aromas of apricot jam on brie cheese rind show on the nose of this bottling from one of the region's oldest vineyards. There is tight focus to the palate, where green pear skins, pomelo pith, lemon zest and lime juice weave into an acidity that's strong yet expertly integrated.",92,37.0
1643,Concha y Toro,"A rich wine with ample barrel influence on the nose along with white fruit aromas. Healthy and big in the mouth, with a flavor profile that blends tropical flavors with citrus. Deep and lightly toasted on the finish, with an excellent feel and texture out the door. Noticeably less oaky than in the past.",90,35.0
1644,Gary Farrell,"Tastes fruity and tart in Lifesaver orange, lemon and apricot flavors, enriched with oak and brightened with beautifully crisp acidity. Feels strong and flattering now. Let it breathe in the glass.",90,45.0
1645,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"A sweet wine, but lively, touched by honey, its acidity coming through as delicious final fruit and spice.",90,55.0
1646,Albert Bichot,"A very vibrant, lively wine, all mineral and fresh acidity. There is some austerity  as the fruit still needs to round out; but it promises to develop well, with delicious green apple and grapefruit flavors. Keep this for 3–4 years.",92,32.0
1647,Williams Selyem,"The very fine Allen Vineyard, on Westside Road in the tenderloin of the appellation, has produced a high-quality Chardonnay that is capable of some bottle aging. Dry and savory, it shows a strong mineral component to the pie filling limes, lemondrop, apple, fig and roasted hazelnut flavors. Should develop before fading, over the next 5 years.",92,48.0
1648,Kunde,"A new bottling from Kunde, and one of their most successful reds ever. A Cabernet-Merlot blend, it shows earthy, tobacco-edged flavors of cherries, raspberries, blackberries, carob, vanilla and cedar. It turns away from the current overripe style in favor of Bordeaux-style balance and elegance. Best now through 2008.",92,40.0
1649,Chehalem,"A single-vineyard wine from Oregon can be a component rather than a complete wine, but here it is an absolute joy. Fragrant and complex, this offers pleasures for both nose and palate, with scents of leaf and spice and herb, leading into a surprisingly dense and textural blend of wild berry, rhubarb, melon and mixed tropical fruits. Fascinating and long, this is a fine example of Oregon Pinot at its most elegant and fascinating.",92,44.0
1650,Williams Selyem,"This single-vineyard Zin is a considerable improvement over the ‘04. The alcohol in the ‘05 is far lower, almost a full percent, yielding a more balanced and harmonious wine. But it's hardly shy. It's powerful in wild blackberry, cassis, raspberry, root beer, tangerine, chocolate and sweet thyme, while the tannic structure is rich enough to warrant bottle aging for a decade.",92,45.0
1651,Lynmar,"Shy in the glass, this wine needs more time in bottle to unravel its complexities of rose petal and cardamom, flanked by crisp red cherry and raspberry. Tangy acidity is the star and backbone of the lovely, structured wine, which is delightful now, but worth cellaring through 2023.",94,60.0
1652,Santa Ema,"Pear and melon aromas get a boost from the barrel, but ultimately the nose on this Chardonnay is simple. In the mouth, things run smooth. Barrel-related flavors of spice, hickory and toast dominate white-fruit notes, while the finish is oaky but balanced in feel.",87,15.0
1653,Robert Mondavi,"Juicy in tropical mango, coconut flake and guava, this sophisticated Chardonnay is measured in texture and weight, the body lean with a touch of vanilla richness on the finish.",88,40.0
1654,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"This is a pretty late release for such an inexpensive wine, but its hard, reductive shell may be the reason it's been held back for so long. Herbs and spices drift up from the glass, along with peppery raspberry fruit. But overall it's a tough nut to crack, and should be decanted well in advance.",86,13.0
1655,Testarossa,"Winemaker Bill Brousseau taps his family vineyard for this bottling that leans toward a more delicate style, offering light white flowers, yellow melon, tangerine peels, kumquat, Asian pear and a hint of clove and cinnamon spice. A baking-soda energy pops on the palate, where lemon blossoms and pink-grapefruit rinds collide for a tart chorus.",92,48.0
1656,Testarossa,"One of the four vineyards that this winery entirely uses as a monopole bottling, this wine shows smoked pork, baked raspberry, crushed rosebuds and a touch of sesame on the nose. The palate's backbone is a tangy cranberry fruit that is enhanced by pencil lead and cedar spice.",92,64.0
1657,Montes,"Deep purple in color, this cool-vintage Syrah excels via smooth cherry, cassis, cedar and charcoal aromas. A full-bodied palate is balanced by firm acidity, while plum, berry, cassis and chocolate flavors finish in harmony. Drink through 2020.",92,23.0
1658,Wines & Winemakers,"A fruity and aromatic wine that is a blend of Syrah and Castelão. It has bright red fruits and a soft, ripe character. Berries and acidity complement the round finish.",84,13.0
1659,Kendall-Jackson,"While this wine is crisp and clean, and the price is right, it's a little thin in flavor. Suggests peaches, pears and citrus fruits that finish with a touch of honey. It's okay for everyday food, especially Asian.",84,13.0
1660,Williams Selyem,"Williams Selyem is now playing the unoaked game, and with their fruit sources, wow. Most winemakers would kill to put oak onto these grapes. The wine is tremendous in pineapples, pears, papayas and kiwi fruit. It's so rich, you won't even notice the absence of caramel and all those oaky influences.",93,35.0
1661,Wines & Winemakers,"Produced by the cooperative of Santo Isidro de Pegões south of Lisbon, this wine comes from the grape variety that's planted across the region. It's an open, soft wine, great for pasta dishes with plenty of ripe fruits and gentle tannins. Drink now.",84,12.0
1662,Bründlmayer,"Bone dry, deliciously crisp, this young Riesling exudes minerality, steel and flint while giving flavors of green apple, grapefruit and white currant. It shows great acidity in its tight, taut finish.",90,38.0
1663,Louis Latour,"Firm and hard, this shows density rather than fruit, tannin rather than freshness. It goes for the dark side of Clos Vougeot. There is some bitterness from the extraction, but the wine needs many years before it comes into balance—the juicy red fruit finish promises richness later.",90,240.0
1664,Georges Duboeuf,"Dark-hued wine, dominated by acidity as well as firm tannins. It shows solid, chunky structure, ripe fruit and plenty of sweetness. Of course, there is acidity as well, the charm of Gamay coming through in the fresh cherry flavors. Age 2–3 years.",92,14.0
1665,V. Sattui,"A big, lusty, rich Zinfandel, packing wildly complex flavors of summer-ripe raspberries and cherries, anise, crushed pepper, dusty spices, sweet vanilla and smoky sandalwood. One of V. Sattui's best Zins of the vintage.",92,35.0
1666,V. Sattui,"Lots of rich, heady flavors in this delicious young Cabernet Sauvignon. It appeals now for the intense blackberry, cherry, cassis, dark chocolate and anise flavors, but such is the tannic intensity that it should easily age. Hold until 2015 and try again.",92,60.0
1667,Georges Duboeuf,"The 2009 vintage of this wine was one of the stars from Georges Duboeuf, and this 2010 fits the same pattern. It has great richness, spice, black cherry fruits, the acidity offering the fruity side of the wine. Ready for aging two years.",92,15.0
1668,Robert Mondavi,"A simple wine, but the price is right, and it will do well at a big party. Shows sweetly ripe blackberry and cherry fruit, with a nice, full-bodied mouthfeel.",84,11.0
1669,Robert Mondavi,"For the price, a pretty good Chardonnay. It's dryish to sweet, with pineapple, orange, buttered toast and vanilla flavors.",84,11.0
1670,DFJ Vinhos,"The most successful wine in the medium-sweet Portada range, with its light honey and lemon flavors, both crisp and soft, ready to drink.",84,
1671,Testarossa,"Woody aromatics of myrrh and frankincense meld with crushed cinnamon, condensed hibiscus, red berries and black pepper on the nose of this bottling. Black cherry shows at the tip of the sip, then drops into incense, pine and juniper flavors, revealing cola and coffee notes toward the finish.",92,64.0
1672,Gary Farrell,"Although pricey for a rosé, this shows wonderful  complexity. The grapes come from two well-regarded vineyards, and the wine shows an elegant structure, with crisp acids and a dusting of tannins. It tastes of rose petals, herb tea, raspberries and nectarines.",91,28.0
1673,Robert Mondavi,"This wine offers a wealth of big flavor and plush structure within a context of savory oak and firm tannin. Black olive and licorice highlight a nicely composed framework of plum and dark cherry, dotted with fresh tobacco.",90,25.0
1674,Trapiche,"Dark berry aromas are smoky and stout, and overall this well-oaked Malbec gives off a sense of seriousness on the nose. In the mouth, there's tension but also balance. Flavors of blackberry and cassis are oaky but expressive. It's spicy, a touch resiny and lasting on the finish. Drink through 2019.",90,25.0
1675,V. Sattui,"Golden in color, this is a creamy voluptuous white wine, fermented and aged entirely in new French oak. Melon, spicy nutmeg and fig build flavor around a core of thick texture and concentration, finishing in buttery toast.",90,60.0
1676,Casa Santos Lima,The Arinto grape is a Lisboa specialty and this lightly wood-aged wine shows it to great advantage. Plenty of acidity and a crisp texture are balanced by vanilla and creamy apple. This fine wine is ready to drink.,90,20.0
1677,Louis Jadot,"A complete wine. As it starts in the mouth, there is a feeling of everything in its place. The tannins are initially soft, dusty rather than dry; then the dark plums, red berries and so-sweet strawberries come into play. And finally, they all come together in a climax of richness and freshness.",98,134.0
1678,Louis Jadot,"This is a powerhouse of a wine. It is driven forward by immense tannins as well as by superrich fruit that still keeps itself in check by a velvet texture. There is spice, acidity, some toast and vanilla, and finally a sunburst of warmth.",98,138.0
1679,Louis Jadot,"A supremely integrated wine, its richness and beautiful fruit just part of a story that starts with intense aromas and segues on the palate into a balance of tannins, dark red fruits, enveloping acidity and a beautifully orchestrated finale of berries, spice and aching freshness.",97,95.0
1680,Louis Jadot,"Beautiful, aromatic wine, with raspberry fruit floating above the spice and toast. This is shot through with acidity and some dense tannins, but above all it is the piercing fruit that dominates. One of Jadot's signature wines, it is wonderful, with considerable aging potential.",96,125.0
1681,Louis Jadot,"Opulent yet so elegant, this wine has already achieved great balance. It comes from the soft richness of the generous fruit, the spice from both the wood and the fruit, and the roundness of the texture, which envelops you in its warmth and ripeness. And, at the end, just to give a great lift, along comes the acidity.",95,90.0
1682,Montes,"Baked apple, pulpy citrus and oak aromas create a soft nose. In the mouth, this feels wide and resiny, and the flavors match that lead: oak, resin, vanilla, tropical fruit and citrus are all registering. On the finish, this is oaky and resiny.",87,25.0
1683,Foxen,"An aromatic profile of crushed mint, hot gravel and red fruit introduces this blend of 83% Grenache and 17% Mourvèdre. It's lightweight on the palate, but with complex flavors of herb and spice that swirl around a core of blackberry fruit and finish with mouthwatering acidity.",92,40.0
1684,Montes,"As per usual, Purple Angel is a full-force experience. Hailing from a warm year, this is dense and purple in color, as it should be. Aromas of graphite, oak, tobacco and black fruit set up a jammy, full palate with saturated flavors of spice-laden blueberry and boysenberry. Finishing notes of tobacco, herb and oak cement this big-boned wine's ripe, beefy status. Drink through 2018.",92,85.0
1685,Wines & Winemakers,"This is a finely perfumed wine, full of ripe Castelão grapes. It has a smooth, polished feeling from the wood aging, yet still allows plenty of room for a dense black-fruit character. It will need to age and will be best after 2016.",92,17.0
1686,Robert Mondavi,"Gets the Cabernet job done with sweetish blackberry and black currant flavors, tinged with oak-like notes. But it's a fundamentally uninteresting wine, even at this price.",82,11.0
1687,Robert Mondavi,"There's a harsh edge of acidic, green sharpness to this wine. It's bone dry, with very modest blackberry fruit.",82,11.0
1688,Foxen,"Light and vivacious on the nose, this offers lime blossoms, Anjou pear skins and sharp white jasmine flowers. The aromas settle into a salted peach-candy character. Tonic, lime blossoms and lime-zest flavors show on the palate, quite bright and nearly tropical.",89,32.0
1689,Undurraga,"Smoky nuances of campfire and hickory are detectable on a nose that's anchored by generic berry scents. This is medium in body, with juicy fresh acidity. Snappy piquant red-fruits turn spicy and peppery on a steady finish.",87,14.0
1690,Kendall-Jackson,"A pleasant sipper with some real depth and varietal character. The plummy, blackberry flavors have a nice streak of mocha and dried herbs, and are wrapped in fine, easy tannins. Feels good and clean through the spicy finish.",86,16.0
1691,Santa Ema,"The bouquet kicks up hints of graham cracker, iodine and earth. The mouth is fat and broad, with a goodly amount of typical plum and cherry flavors. The finish is simple yet clean, with tight tannins and moderate length. Good and well made; a wine for everyday consumption.",87,14.0
1692,Concha y Toro,"Concha y Toro is making a big, burly Merlot for this line and it should have mass appeal given how rich, extracted and oaky it is. The nose is dense as chocolate cake and deep as a well. The mouth is chewy and thick, with chocolate-covered berries and another whack of wood.",87,14.0
1693,Santa Ema,"Fresh and forward. The nose is pure, ripe and rubbery, with a deep level of black fruit. The mouthfeel shows zippy acidity and total ripeness of the grapes. The grippy finish is long and rock solid. The tannins make it a touch hard, but with food you can't really fail.",87,12.0
1694,Undurraga,"Spicy and peppery, with lots of body and richness. In a word, it's true Carmenère. The fruit here is ripe and lush, with plenty of herbal essence, and for every drop of plum or black cherry there's a balancing hint of green herb and bell pepper, which does not signal underripeness. The finish is tight and long, with some espresso flavor. If you're interested in trying a well-made Carmenère, give this a go.",87,11.0
1695,Testarossa,"Rustic, hearty aromas of tar, cola, herbs and burnt rhubarb make for an intriguing nose on this entry-level bottling from Testarossa. The sips feature cola and cherry flavors, with a very quick finish.",84,27.0
1696,Foxen,"Exceptionally rich, a Pinot Noir that tastes dramatic from the get go. It's full-bodied, dry and velvety, with complex flavors of berries, pomegranates, cherries, cola, currants, mushrooms and spices. The firm tannins and crisp acids suggest ageability over the next six years.",92,56.0
1697,Foxen,"With 50% new oak aging, the wood stands out now, showing caramelized and buttered toast flavors. Under that is a dry, tannic wine, filled with raspberries, cherries and spicy pomegranates. Complex and pedigreed, it wants some time in the cellar. Better after 2014.",92,56.0
1698,V. Sattui,"A really good Zinfandel, and despite hefty alcohol, it's dry and balanced. Really delivers those Zin flavors of wild berries, leather, anise, cocoa and cola, and the spices are a wild ride through Asia. With thick, velvety tannins and acidity, it's a lovely, classy Zin to drink now.",92,36.0
1699,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Smooth and spicy, matching bright, tight, sweet-tart lemony fruit to nicely integrated barrel notes of sandalwood and graham cracker. The sleek structure, balanced for cellaring as well as immediate enjoyment.",92,25.0
1700,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Reserve caliber fruit—a throat-coating mix of blueberry, cherry and cassis—rolls into a rich, full throttle wash of barrel flavors. Toast, smoke, espresso and dark chocolate give the wine depth and gravitas. Ageworthy to be sure, but also enjoyable right now.",91,28.0
1701,Columbia Crest,"Possibly the best Walter Clore to date, this is firm, with substantial dark-fruit flavors swathed in swirls of loam, blood, sweet tomato and red licorice. The relative coolness of the vintage seems to have allowed extra details to emerge, and the barrel aging has been handled sensitively.",91,
1702,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Underbrush, black-skinned fruit, exotic spice, leather and balsamic aromas emerge on this full-bodied red. The austere structured palate offers dried black cherry, star anise, tobacco and clove framed in bracing, fine-grained tannins. Don't even attempt it for another few years. Drink 2021–2031.",92,70.0
1703,Testarossa,"Bright and fresh aromas of black currant and Concord grape meet with violet and a sense of chalkiness on the nose of this blend of 57% Cabernet Franc, 29% Cabernet Sauvignon and 14% Merlot. The sip is bone-dry, relying on a graphite backbone and relatively light body to carry forth purple fruit flavors.",92,54.0
1704,Wines & Winemakers,This organic vineyard in the northern reaches of Tejo regularly produces concentrated wines like this. It's richly endowed with fine tannins and black fruit but also has the sort of structure that will allow it to age well. Drink from 2019.,91,18.0
1705,Concha y Toro,"Aromas of olive, mushroom and berry fruits are lightly herbal. This Cabernet feels scratchy, abrupt and edgy, while herbal raspberry and plum flavors finish solid and with a slight note of pickle.",87,18.0
1706,Undurraga,"This blend of Viognier, Roussane and Marsanne isn't typically Chilean but it doesn't smell or taste all that French, either. Tropical floral aromas are similar to bath oil, while this feels full, pulpy and oily. Peach and persimmon flavors finish distinctly salty, with an oily feel and flavor notes of citrus peel.",87,15.0
1707,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"A big and friendly wine, with plenty of forward fruit mingling flavors of citrus, apples and pears. There is a nice blast of vanilla too, the only obvious sign of new oak aging, but the impression overall is of crisp, clean elegance. Best Buy.",89,13.0
1708,Montes,"Hand-picked fruit from La Finca Estate in this case equals a real black beauty—one taster imagined that this would be difficult to drink without a hefty grilled steak. Smoldering smoke, ash and black fruit aromas make way for similar char, tar, licorice and blackberry flavors on the palate and on the finish. Drink from 2004.",88,72.0
1709,Kendall-Jackson,"Dark, viscous and monumental, this Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend detonates on the palate with black currants, chocolate and cedar concentration, wrapped into the most perfect tannins. Outstanding, and should age for many years. Only 277 cases of this wine, which was grown on steep hillsides, were produced.",97,125.0
1710,Kunde,"Toasty, smoky aromas from new oak come close to concealing shy apples and citrus fruits, but the strong spicy flavors assert themselves on the palate. A very long finish completes the picture.",88,20.0
1711,Kunde,"Marked by powerful oak influences and sur-lie aging, this Kunde offering features strong, forward aromas of the ripest pears and apples, but maintains a light quality on the palate.",88,20.0
1712,Robert Mondavi,"This wine, from the man who invented the name ""Fumé Blanc,"" is not for everyone. It's way on the citrus, hay, and gooseberry side of the chart (as it is in every vintage), making for a lean, tart, almost sharp drink that some will find sour despite softening with 6% Sémillon and lees aging. Others will appreciate the sleek, almost severe elegance. Again, a wine that absolutely demands the right foods.",88,28.0
1713,Robert Mondavi,"This is a dark-colored, dense wine, reeking of aromas fresh from the fermenting tank: juicy blackberry and plum and a strong herbal, earthy streak like mulch and mushrooms. It's well made and clean as a whistle, but currently the profile is austere, although some fruity depth on the finish bodes well for the long haul. Cellar for three years before trying.",87,35.0
1714,Louis Latour,"A charming and rich wine, with tannins that nestle within the soft texture. It is approachable, packed with ripe red fruits in an attractive juicy texture. The finish has enticing acidity.",91,135.0
1715,Robert Mondavi,"Shows the dryness, acidity and minerality that always mark this Sauvignon Blanc, which is from the vineyard directly behind the Oakville winery. The flavors are lean and elegant, suggesting citrus fruits and Asian pears, with a hint of tart, sour gooseberry. An elegant wine to drink as an appetizer.",91,40.0
1716,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"A touch of fresh bay leaf, wet earth and musk rose combine to make a very enticing intriguing nose. The resolutely dry palate carries these lovely aromatics with zesty freshness and lovely zesty texture that is reminiscent of grapefruit peel. It is its abiding freshness that makes this stand out.",91,26.0
1717,Testarossa,"Not the most successful Rosella's Pinot ever. The flavors are rich enough, suggesting raspberries, cherries and cola, and the wine is dry and silky. But there's an acidic sharpness, reminiscent of mint jelly, that deranges the palate.",86,59.0
1718,Concha y Toro,"Pear, apple and a drop of petrol work the nose on this German-style Riesling from Chile. A touch of spritz offers bubbly zest to the palate feel, while acid-driven flavors of lemon-lime, mango, pineapple and white peach finish chalky and a touch sweet.",88,39.0
1719,Chehalem,"Quite tart and perhaps just a bit underripe, this red checks in at barely 12% alcohol. It has a bit of a Band-Aid scent that competes with the light berry flavors.",85,24.0
1720,Albert Bichot,"For a wine meant to be consumed now, this is almost too tannic. It has bright fruit and a flavor of black currant skin, plus a dry, tannic core.",85,13.0
1721,Bründlmayer,"A full, yeasty wine, this has gentle acidity, with a touch of smokiness as well as a note of apple It feels full, without the necessary crispness.",85,44.0
1722,Iron Horse,"This estate Chardonnay is keeping stylistically with the winery's other offerings, though a tad weightier and richer in oak and crème brûlée. Fresh peach, pineapple and anise intermingle on the palate, with a silky yet complex texture. There is a palate-refreshing hint of lime on the finish.",93,29.0
1723,Gary Farrell,"Light and floral, this is a complex, well-integrated Chardonnay that's bursting in just-sliced pineapple, with a layering of butterscotch and caramel. It's richly textured yet nicely balanced between savory and sweet. The acidity upholds the wine from entering into dense territory, a celebration of one heck of a sunny vintage in a glass.",93,45.0
1724,Robert Mondavi,"Rich and concentrated in blackberry essence, black currant and mocha, this has smooth tannins and a long, complex, dry finish. Delicacy, not to mention ageability, is somewhat compromised by the heat of high alcohol, but still, it's a flashy effort to drink over the next few years. The grapes come from the esteemed To Kalon Vineyard immediately behind the winery.",90,135.0
1725,Gary Farrell,"There's a reductive element to the nose of this wine, indicating the powerful nature of the vintage but also the wine's youth. Let it open to unveil an intensity of baked apple and white peach, along with heartier highlights of crème brûlée and vanilla toast. With a medium body and length, it has enough acidity to remain vibrant. It's sourced from a who's who of the region's vineyards.",90,35.0
1726,Columbia Crest,"The oak (40% new French and American) is up front, with aromas of barrel spices, cocoa and generous amounts of vanilla followed by cherries and blue fruit. This wine is velvety in feel, displaying a mixture of fruit and barrel that carries through the finish. The oak influence is heavy but the appeal is impossible to ignore.",90,15.0
1727,Gary Farrell,"The producer continues to hit it out of the park with this vintage of Pinot, offering a gorgeously balanced interpretation of a marquee vineyard site. Rose petal and lavender aromas evolve into flavors of rosemary, high-toned orange peel, dried cherry and cranberry on the palate, keeping things ethereal throughout. Smooth and medium bodied, the tannins are coy and the entire experience memorable.",94,70.0
1728,Fess Parker,"This elegant bottling is named after the late actor-turned-vintner's daughter, who still runs the company. It features well-integrated aromas of cherry, rhubarb and smoke. That smoke also shows on the palate, where piquant raspberry, dried lavender, thyme, rosemary and allspice sizzle toward a lively finish.",93,50.0
1729,Testarossa,"This appellation blend from the single-vineyard-focused winery offers a great look at the region, showing a pithy nose full of Meyer lemon as well as a touch of yogurt. The mouthfeel is grippy with lots of nervous tension, which is much more interesting than the standard range of citrus flavors on display.",91,38.0
1730,Wines & Winemakers,"This soft, caramel flavored rosé is produced from the native Castelão grape in coastal Setúbal south of Lisbon. With rounded red fruits and light acidity, it is dry and destined to pair with food.",84,11.0
1731,Wines & Winemakers,A beetroot character to this wine is off-putting. It masks the fruit and acidity that otherwise would show well.,83,22.0
1732,Wines & Winemakers,"The wine is fresh, aromatic and so crisp. Made from Fernão Pires and Verdelho, it is ripe with apple flavors and tangy with orange zest. The wine is young, fruity and ready to drink.",86,20.0
1733,Testarossa,"Rich and creamy in pineapple, orange and lime fruit, with a sweet coating of new oak, this Chardonnay is balanced with zesty acidity. It's an opulent, flashy wine.",90,41.0
1734,Testarossa,"Rich and ripe in tropical fruit, apricot and peach flavors, this oaky Chardonnay is brightened by crisp acidity. The oakiness returns in the finish, which suggests buttered toast. Drink now.",90,41.0
1735,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"This vineyard-designated Merlot includes 14% Cabernet Sauvignon. This vintage, Syrah is eliminated and alcohol is lowered—a welcome shift. Rich and loaded with black fruits, it carries interesting accents of caramel popcorn, yielding a delicious, tongue-coating wine with a silky-smooth mouthfeel. It has good length, and the possibility of aging for another five or six years.",90,26.0
1736,Santa Ema,"The Carmenère in this Carm-Cabernet-Syrah blend is the lead singer, so expect a touch of minty green and herbal essence. It's a heavyweight in the sense that the mouthfeel is big and the tannins are a little hard. But with airing it unveils classy, spicy berry flavors and wood-based accents of vanilla and butter (20 months in new oak will do that). A big wine that needs some airing. Ready now but can rest well in the cellar for a few more years.",91,68.0
1737,Gary Farrell,"From the historic family-owned vineyard down a ways on Westside Road, this Bacigalupi wine is richer and more layered than some of the producer's other vineyard-designates, providing a meatier, more tropical edge of fleshy butter and nuttiness. The aromatics balance things out, sharing whispers of orange blossom and caramel.",90,50.0
1738,Georges Duboeuf,"From one of the properties where Duboeuf does vinification and bottling at the estate, this is a dense and structured wine. While it does have intense, young acidity, it also offers ripe berry fruits that are bold and rich. Drink from 2016.",90,20.0
1739,Gary Farrell,"Almond and anise open what evolves into a concentrated expression of a stellar vineyard site in a great vintage in good winemaking hands. Honey and baked peach initially fool the palate into anticipating that this wine might head into full-blown hedonism, but subtle layers of lemon, grapefruit and pear keep it crisp, fresh and ultimately complex. Creamy, it retains plenty of acidity for balance.",94,45.0
1740,Lynmar,"From 40-plus-year-old vines planted on old rootstock, this wine is tangy in pomegranate, rhubarb and kirsch, but marked most by an irresistible depth of earthy truffle and black tea. Fine, dusty tannins add to the complexity of the mouthfeel and finish, with a hint of cinnamon at the end.",93,70.0
1741,Concha y Toro,"This is about as racy as Sauvignon Blanc from Chile gets. It's green and melon-like on the nose, with punchy asparagus and lime aromas. It is wide awake on the palate, where citrusy acids push lemon, lime, green herb and lemongrass flavors. It cuts like a razor; drink with shellfish.",90,25.0
1742,Williams Selyem,"Although this wine is easy to drink now, it shows the Williams Selyem signature of complexity and balance. Delicious in raspberry, cherry and cola fruit, it has crisp acidity and a sweet coat of oak. It's a blend of several vineyards from which the winery sources fruit.",90,52.0
1743,Montes,"While the nose on this sweetie isn't deep, it's lush, inviting and peachy as they come. The palate feels fresh and straightforward, and the flavor profile blends tropical fruit flavors with spice and honey accents. Overall this seems natural, easygoing and expressive.",90,27.0
1744,Bründlmayer,"Ripe and full, this has layers of refreshing green-fruit, apple and cream flavors, enlivened by fresh acidity. It has a light touch of orange zest that gives extra vitality to this ready-to-drink wine.",90,
1745,Chehalem,"This unoaked, tank-fermented, no-malolactic style delivers flavors as crisp and refreshing as a clear mountain stream. Steely and mineral-driven, its apple and pear flavors carry just a tongue-tickling hint of butter.",90,19.0
1746,Montes,"Light, elegant and lithe on the nose, with a touch of stemminess to the core plum and cherry aromas. Feels just right, with a feminine touch and snap to the mouthfeel. Flavors of red plum, raspberry, herbs, tomato and dried spice lead to a fresh, focused finish. Top level for under $15.",89,14.0
1747,Albert Bichot,"This monopole within the Chablis grand cru vineyards produces top Chablis. In 2006, the wine is powerful, but layered with intense minerality, a flinty character on top of the ripe white and yellow fruits. It has concentration, a depth of flavor that is impressive. It will age well.",94,90.0
1748,Chanson Père et Fils,"This is from a sub-division of the Corton vineyard, at the northern end of the Grand Cru. It shows both depth of flavor and freshness, a ripe wine that brings in delicious, appetizing acidity and spicy toast. It will obviously age, the nuts and secondary flavors still waiting to show, but as a fruitier style it will be ready in a year.",94,235.0
1749,Concha y Toro,"Rich and concentrated for an entry-level wine, with earthy, bold aromas and a lush, well-balanced palate feel. Deep and sweet in terms of flavor, with a mix of ripe black fruits and herbs. Shows a bit of faux oak flavor on a mocha-tinged finish. Exemplary for this price range.",86,8.0
1750,Maryhill,"Light fruit suggests strawberries with a slightly green edge. The tannins are still a bit rough and tumble, with a peppery kick.",85,17.0
1751,Foxen,"Reserved on the nose, this bottling by Billy Wathen and Dick Dore from their friend Rick Longoria's vineyard offers cranberry, fennel, lavender and a touch of smoke on the nose. It's delicate in its approach, with tightly woven strawberry, red plum and cranberry fruit lifted by dried sagebrush and more of that wildfire smoke.",92,66.0
1752,Georges Duboeuf,"Light, freshly red cherry-dominated wine. The light tannins are a background to the acidity and the fresh fruit. Easy style of Beaujolais.",85,
1753,Chanson Père et Fils,"This wine has an earthy character, with some bitter flavors as well as more generous acidity and yellow fruits, The earthiness should blow off as it develops to give a ripe, richly fruity wine.",87,25.0
1754,Fess Parker,"There's a palate-warming generosity to this single-vineyard Pinot, a result of its softly balanced texture and the smoothness of new oak. Luxurious flavors of smoky cherries and currants, roasted nuts, molasses and honey taste almost like an energy fruit bar from the health food store. This lovely, supple wine should develop through 2012.",90,58.0
1755,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"The Cold Creek Chardonnay is built upon 30-year-old vines, fully ripened at this warm site. Sensuous, soft and broadly laced with flavors of toasted nuts, brioche and apple pie, this luxurious Chardonnay still maintains a pleasing, focused structure that carries along flavors of lemon and apple, cut against the dominant oak. Cold Creek wines are among Washington's most ageworthy.",90,25.0
1756,Georges Duboeuf,"A textured, structured wine, solid and packed with tannins. It is full of concentrated black currant and prune flavors, layered with dark coffee. It is worth aging for at least 1–2 years.",90,
1757,Robert Mondavi,"This unoaked, low-alcohol Sauvignon Blanc is really elegant, and shows how you don't have to spend a lot to get a fine wine. It's dry, crisp and rich in lemon, lime, pineapple and vanilla flavors, with a savory creaminess from sur lie aging. A brilliant value; production was 77,500 cases.",89,11.0
1758,Lynmar,"Honeycomb and slight tropical flourish accent bright minerality in this fuller-styled, integrated white that offers a plush ripeness without ever succumbing to sweetness. Toasted oak and anise layer over a texture of baked apple dusted in nutmeg.",94,60.0
1759,Lynmar,"Named for the clone so beloved by winemakers, this white is sourced from two estate vineyards. It opens in confectionary aromas that lead into a full-bodied style that's lushly voluptuous and exotic, yet completely in balance, a celebration of lemon curd, nutmeg and tarte Tatin.",94,55.0
1760,Foxen,"Quite light in the glass, this bottling offers a strongly sage-driven nose bolstered by light licorice and chipped slate that's laced through the tangy cranberry and pretty red-cherry aromas. It's easy and light on the sip but with a full flavor profile, from pomegranate to snappy raspberry, thyme, oregano, dill and tons of pepper.",94,64.0
1761,Testarossa,"A best-of-barrels selection from the winery's various vineyards, this is a lush, intricate Chardonnay made in the modern style. It's fantastically rich in pineapple tart flavors, with the sweet, smoky crust, and more acidic citrus notes of Meyer lemons and limes. Oak aging and lees add fortunate layers of buttered toast and cream. Very intricate, with Chablisian dryness and minerality. Now–2014.",95,55.0
1762,Testarossa,"A very finely crafted Pinot Noir, although it's also very young and wants some time in the cellar. Combines great Highlands fruit power and tannic structure with a silky, delicate mouthfeel. Beautiful now for the elaborate raspberry and cherry flavors, elaborated with beautiful oak, but better after 2013.",94,54.0
1763,Casa Santos Lima,This is an aromatic wine with generous fruit and soft tannins. Its wood aging has given the wine extra richness as well as spice. The wine is ready to drink.,84,10.0

1765,DFJ Vinhos,"This has soft, ripe fruit, with notes of lime and orange zest fitting easily with the ripe peach and melon flavors. This is warm, rounded and ready to drink.",85,7.0
1766,Georges Duboeuf,"With some tannins, even a touch of wood, this is a weighty wine, giving juicy plum flavors along with acidity. It is rich and concentrated, although ready to drink now.",90,

1768,Casa Santos Lima,This rich wine comes from the far south of Portugal. It is structured and dense with black-plum fruit and firm tannins. Spice and grilled toast from wood aging and acidity gives this wine a good balance as well as ripeness. Drink now.,88,20.0
1769,DFJ Vinhos,"This wine has weight and considerable richness. Spice and an attractive perfume meld with the blackberry fruits and juicy acidity. The Castelão grape is at home in this region, which shows in the sense of terroir in this bold wine. Drink now.",88,10.0
1770,DFJ Vinhos,"Part of a series that showcases major grape varieties, this wine brings out the creamy, green and apple-fruit character of the Chardonnay. It conveys hints of tropical fruits and a ripe apricot flavor. Balanced acidity lifts all this rich fruitiness. Drink from late 2017.",88,13.0
1771,Bründlmayer,"The shy nose gives mere glimpses of zesty lemon. The palate seems to have a stony, earthy core, a central point from which freshness and impact radiate. This is incredibly juicy and mouthwatering, slowly showing ripe Mirabelle fruit framed by juicy, ripe lemon and tangerine notes. The body is dry, light and mouthwatering, while the whistle-clean finish reels you in with its juiciness.",92,31.0
1772,Fess Parker,"Fresh aromas of salty lemon cream, wet slate and riverstones, as well as a touch of slightly sour yogurt, show on the nose of this bottling from the vineyard named after Fess Parker's daughter, who now runs much of the company. The lively palate combines squeezes of citrus with a creamy mouthfeel that offers hints of nuts and orangesicle. It's a very cohesive wine.",92,37.0
1773,Albert Bichot,"Packed with ripe black- and red-fruit flavors, this wine is dense and concentrated. The rich, generous fruit comes with a complex minerally edge, and it shows the wood influence in the form of a spice note. Age this at least six years.",90,
1774,Albert Bichot,"Typical of Volnay, this wine has a velvety character that surrounds the firm tannins. The acidity is palpable through the warm red-berry flavors and firm edge. It is certainly a wine for aging, although it is also likely to be drinkable in 2–3 years.",90,
1775,Testarossa,"This brilliant Chardonnay has the ripe citrus and tropical fruit you want, but is also refined in winemaker technique, particularly a leesy note that marries well with the pineapples in sweet clotted cream. The oak is perfect and the acidity lovely in this wonderfully drinkable wine.",93,39.0
1776,Kendall-Jackson,"This serious red blend puts together a texture firmed up with gripping tannins and acidity, flavors brimming with blackberry and sweet spices and a lingering finish. Too structured to appreciate alone, it will need pairing with roast beef, lasagna, ribs or the like.",88,17.0
1777,Casa Santos Lima,"One of the top wines from this producer, this blend of at least 10 grape varieties comes from its estate. The wood aging has added sophistication to this already concentrated wine. With black fruits to the fore and firm tannins, it will age well. Drink from 2019.",92,26.0
1778,Louis Latour,"A rich, lush melange of fruit and nuts, with sinuous, almost unctuous flavors that twine around the palate like a snake. Long, fascinating finish, elegantly balanced and precise.",92,55.0
1779,Kendall-Jackson,"Very aromatic, showing a complex nose of cherry, spice, smoked and raw meat, and tobacco. The flavors are copious, too, with strong black cherry, licorice and tobacco elements. Balance and structure are beautiful here, and the coffee-chocolate finish has very good length, showing spice and blueberry accents. Lovely already, it will be better in four years and will drink well to 2010.",91,100.0
1780,Santa Ema,Green apple is the lead aroma along with yeasty vanilla and a dash of white pepper. There's modest roundness to the palate and nonscouring bright acidity. Slightly candied lime and mango flavors feature controlled bitterness on the finish.,86,10.0
1781,Santa Ema,"A creamy, faux-smelling-and-tasting wine with loads of bogus oak character and limited stuffing or quality backing it up. Smells like a berry marshmallow or county fair cotton candy, yet the palate is hollow and sour. A masked wine that's trying to be tricky and isn't.",82,14.0
1782,Gary Farrell,"A very rich Chardonnay, explosive in lemon custard, grilled pineapple and the ripest peaches imaginable. At the same time, there's a firm, tangy minerality. Some will find, however, that the oak dominates it all with a blast of buttered toast and caramel.",88,45.0
1783,Fess Parker,"The cool-climate origins of this wine are revealed immediately in the freshly crushed black and white pepper aromas. In the mouth, it's extraordinarily rich in blackberry jam and cassis, with the chocolaty, roasted meat notes that frequently characterize a good Syrah. Although it's pretty tannic, it's appealing now, and should develop for 4–5 more years.",90,28.0
1784,Kendall-Jackson,"This is a big, full Zinfandel that's blended with 19% Petite Sirah and 1% Chardonnay. With the right balance between fruit and spice, the wine is a liquid version of blackberry jam on toast.",87,17.0
1785,Fess Parker,"Plump blackberries, sweet violets and a slight brushing of tar show on the nose of this straightforward, everything-you-expect Syrah. Bright acidity contains the dark fruit on the palate, with dense blackberries and elderberries dusted by black pepper and a touch of thyme.",88,28.0
1786,Columbia Crest,"This budget Riesling sets a good standard for the style and the price. It's off-dry, low alcohol (11.5%) and solidly varietal. The fruit is full bodied and ripe, with vivid peach and apricot flavors. Additional notes of honey and lemony breakfast tea keep the finish up and running.",87,8.0
1787,Georges Duboeuf,"A ripe, smoky wine, full of sweet jelly berry fruit. It is rounded and rich, a delicious wine that rolls easily around the mouth.",87,
1788,Maryhill,Appealing aromas of citrus rind and pear lead to fleshy full-fruit flavors. The alcohol pokes through at times but it still provides enjoyment.,87,20.0
1789,Wines & Winemakers,"This wine combines freshness and structure. It's full of acidity and bright berry fruits. At the same time, the solid structure gives the wine balance and a fine future. Wood aging offers further support to the fruitiness of this ageworthy wine. Drink from 2017.",88,18.0
1790,DFJ Vinhos,"With its dark color and rich fruit, this is instantly approachable. Tannins are well integrated into the ripe plum and black cherry fruits. With fresh acidity and a core of dry tannins at the end, the wine could age. Drink from 2016.",87,9.0
1791,Casa Santos Lima,"This big, bold and fruity wine highlights the juicy quality of ripe Castelão. The tannins are just there, forming the base for the ripe red fruits and warm structure. It could do with just a few more months, so drink from late 2015.",87,
1792,Kendall-Jackson,"Tight and tannic, this majority Cab wine is distinguished by a thickness of black fruit and herbaceous back palate that gives it density, separated by bursts of vanilla and oak. Give it time to open and notes of mocha chocolate should also come through.",87,24.0
1793,Bründlmayer,"A curious mix of roasted smokiness and red fruits makes for an appetizing autumnal nose. The red fruit underneath these flavors is beautifully pure and speaks of raspberry and wild strawberries. The wonderfully refreshing tartness zips across the palate like a bright streak of light and gives freshness, direction and poise to everything. The flavors are lasting and long.",92,60.0
1794,Trapiche,"Trapiche has never bottled much Sauvignon Blanc, but this one is true to its name: Pure. Easy citrus aromas are mild and clean. This feels medium in body, with a touch of weight. Orange and other dry citrus flavors are steady across the finish.",86,15.0
1795,Casa Santos Lima,"The oak aging is what makes this wine. It brings out the black fruits and juicy acidity as well as adding toast and vanilla flavors. The result is a wine that is smooth, balanced, full of fruit and ready to drink.",86,20.0
1796,Louis Jadot,"Concentrated and powerful, this wine is rich and full in the mouth, with wonderful ripe fruits over the great tannins. It is solid, dark and dense, full of smoky flavors and a rich strawberry flavor. Drink from 2022.",95,208.0
1797,Foxen,"This wine's magically layered nose blends graphite, black cherries, dried violets, hints of savory smoke meats and the oddly captivating scent of composting rose petals. From a vineyard on the appellation's eastern edge come a spice rack of flavors, from black peppercorns and hoisin sauce to soy and blackberry fruit.",95,48.0
1798,Louis Jadot,"This Beaune bottling has a dense structure that broods through its tannic outer skin. Perfumed red fruits will shortly burst out to give an opulent, rich wine with both great acidity and layers of spice that finish with freshness. Drink from 2021.",95,93.0
1799,Louis Jadot,"Severe and austere at this stage, this solid, dark wine has all the weight of a wine from Gevrey, concentrated and densely tannic. It's firm, packed with dark plum fruit and perfumed acidity. It's foursquare, demanding long aging. Drink from 2021",95,135.0
1800,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"Ethereal notes of orange blossom and jasmine lead to richer tones of damask rose underpinned by a lively orange-peel freshness. The palate presents the same delicious juxtaposition of opulence and light-footed ease. Full of life and fragrant, vigorous joy, the wine has flavors that seem to linger forever.",95,80.0
1801,Iron Horse,"Brut X is an extreme brut, made in a bone-dry style from a blend of 31% Chardonnay and 69% Pinot Noir with no added sugar. It's then aged four years. Floral in honeysuckle, the flavors are sharply focused and salty, a mix of lemon, pear and peach that can be enjoyed before, during and after a meal.",94,50.0
1802,Lynmar,"This is a tremendous blend of various vineyard sites, coaxed together into a stunning combination of beautiful floral aromas, ginger and baked lemon. Given time in half new oak, it takes on flavors of apple and vanilla, never venturing out of range and remaining balanced and textured.",94,35.0
1803,Chanson Père et Fils,"Structured and dense with tannins, this is a big wine with a big future. Its black fruits, acidity and solid texture all point to its weight and richness. It is going to be a rich fruity wine. But wait until 2023.",92,32.0
1804,Foxen,"Very fresh although not particularly fruity aromas of raspberry mesh with allspice, thyme and tarragon on the nose of this block-designate bottling from the historic vineyard. Energetic and lighter red-fruit flavors like pomegranate show on the sip, where fennel is the dominant spice.",92,65.0
1805,Lynmar,"A nice Pinot, light-bodied and dry, with a fine, silky mouthfeel. The cherry flavors have slightly greener notes of menthol, accented with sweet, smoky oak. Drink now.",88,60.0
1806,Gary Farrell,"Although this Chard is less expensive than the winery's Rochioli or Olivet Lane single-vineyard bottlings, it's their equal in terms of richness. Accented with crisp acidity, it shows rich, flamboyant pineapple, papaya and lime flavors, with the buttered toast of oak barrels.",91,38.0
1807,DFJ Vinhos,"A dark colored red that is firmly tannic as well as ripe and fruity. The wine is spicy and earthy, redolent of dried fruits, like figs and red berries. With its solid texture, it can age; drink from 2015.",87,8.0
1808,Kendall-Jackson,"KJ's Avant bottling is refreshing with fruity essence, showing sweet flavors of honey, peaches, apricots and nectarines. With only a touch of oak, it has a bright, fresh mouthfeel that makes it especially attractive.",86,17.0
1809,Undurraga,"Common apple, melon and other green, zesty aromas work the nose, which is slightly more reserved than outright pungent. The palate is flashy but a touch lean, with blazing acidity pushing tart, crisp, focused flavors of green apple and citrus. Not out of the ordinary, but quite well made and cleansing.",88,22.0
1810,Williams Selyem,"Smoky new oak dominates the aromas and flavors of this Pinot Noir, giving a toasty, roasted note. Yet the underlying wine doesn't have the power to support all that wood. Despite the pleasant cherry and raspberry flavors, the oak rules.",88,54.0
1811,Kendall-Jackson,"A delicious fruit bomb, this has all the jammy goodness of blackberry syrup, with just enough tannin and acidity to keep it from being sweet. Smooth on the palate, it's full-bodied, uncomplicated and tasty.",89,17.0
1812,Bründlmayer,"At first, this displays an almost grassy freshness, then fine bubbles bring out a certain savouriness on the palate that would work incredibly well with seafood, tempura or any number of lighter foods. If you are planning a dinner around sparkling wine, put this one on your list. The dry but rich and spicy finish call out for food.",89,22.0
1813,Testarossa,"Sagebrush and faint anise hints decorate the red cherry and ripe raspberry fruit in this appellation blend. The palate is lively if fairly simple, with fresh red berry flavors and a touch of garrigue.",88,48.0

1815,Albert Bichot,"Showing a dry character from the wood aging, this spicy wine also has fruit weight. While it is still young, its ripe berry flavors laced with black cherries are right up front. It does have the rounded character of a Beaune and this will develop more strongly. Drink from 2021.",89,48.0
1816,Concha y Toro,"Dark, rubbery aromas are offset by a floral berry component. Grabby tannins are a big part of this Cabernet's chunky palate. Flavors of hickory, café mocha and roasted berry fruits finish chocolaty and with residual tannins.",89,25.0
1817,Foxen,"Do not pop the cork and drink this right away as it's currently tight and tannic. But as it warms up and breathes, it releases its considerable charms. With 16% Viognier blended in, it's fantastically rich and concentrated in black-pepper-accented raspberry and sweet-smoke flavors. Acidity adds balance to the richness. You can enjoy this wine now, after an hour in the decanter, or cellar it for at least six years.",94,44.0
1818,Foxen,"An especially chilly vintage in the always-cool Santa Maria Valley has resulted in an intense, young Syrah that is dry, tannic and dramatic. Despite its tightness, the flavors of cherry jam, bacon, cola and black pepper explode deliciously. Extremely low yields in the vineyard give this Syrah a density that will allow it to age for 6–8 years, though with decanting, it's fine to drink now.",94,46.0
1819,Chehalem,"With its off-dry tango of sweet, tart and mineral components, this is a standout among a large range of Rieslings from Chehalem. Apple and white peach, citrus oil and wet stone are in play, with some grippy tannins adding a taste of orange pekoe tea. The residual sugar, listed at 16 g/L, is off-set with balancing acidity.",90,29.0
1820,V. Sattui,"This big, blackberry-infused Zinfandel has plenty of leather, roasted coffee, licorice and tobacco notes coming through. It's medium-bodied and complex, with an herbal hint on the finish.",87,37.0
1821,Columbia Crest,"The reserve is still tightly wound, but expressive, with firm, focused flavors of cassis fruit, backed with a refreshing minerality. Chewy and stylish, its briary fruits carry through a long, sculpted finish with light accents of herb.",91,45.0
1822,V. Sattui,"This is a very good dry Gewürztraminer that's laden in jasmine and honey, extremely perfumed on the nose, and light and crisp on the palate. With a suggestion of vanilla on the finish, it's a balanced white, ready to be enjoyed with a salad dressed with figs and goat cheese.",90,24.0
1823,Trapiche,"Mellow but friendly berry aromas feed into a firm palate with tight red-fruit tannins and then ripe flavors of blackberry and chocolate cake. The finish is toasty, with a chocolate mint-chip note and acidic snap.",87,10.0
1824,Robert Mondavi,"From the color— unusually dark for Pinot Noir—to the deeply fruity, earthy aromas, you expect something big, massive and ageworthy, and the first sip confirms this impression. This is serious Pinot. It comes across deep and powerful in the mouth, suggesting plums, sweet blackberries and a hint of sun-warmed tomato, and finishes with a blast of complex oak and spice. Complex now, it calls for complex dishes—the best game birds you can find—and will probably be even better with some time in the cellar.",92,35.0
1825,Siduri,"California-based Siduri cellared and bottled this wine that was vinified in Oregon. Still young and compact, it nonetheless shows some good flesh on its bones. The tannins pop out a bit, along with red berries and a streak of coffee. Another year of bottle age would be helpful, or give it plenty of aeration.",89,39.0
1826,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"The aromas pop, with notes of fresh blueberry pie, sweet herb, dark-roasted coffee and spice. The palate doesn't quite deliver on all those aromas, seeming a bit less bold than the nose suggests. Still, this wine is enjoyable, especially after it has time to open up.",89,50.0
1827,Gary Farrell,"The winery's single-vineyard 2011 Pinots varied widely in this erratic vintage. Dry and tart, the wine is marked by a vegetal streak that cuts through the raspberries and cherries.",85,60.0
1828,Wines & Winemakers,"A ripe wine dominated by tropical pineapple and fresh peach. This warm, lively and fruity wine can be drunk in 2014.",85,12.0
1829,Casa Santos Lima,A rich and fruity blend with swathes of ripe red berry fruits that are smoothed out by the soft wood and tannin flavors. Acidity freshens the ripeness. Drink now.,85,7.0
1830,Concha y Toro,"Mossy, lightly herbal aromas of blackberry and marzipan are attractive. This is rich, loud and racy in the mouth, with vanilla, tobacco, plum and berry flavors that finish long and ride elegantly on a beam of slightly sharp acidity. Drink this fine Carmenère through 2016.",92,50.0
1831,Bründlmayer,"This is the lightest of the Bründlmayer Grüners and refreshing and crisp it is, too. It has green herb freshness and a tense, citrus aftertaste. Pure green fruits dominate. Screwcap.",88,24.0
1832,Iron Horse,"Full and plush, with complex aromas of cassis, cinnamon, earth, cedar, coffee and cream. Low in acidity, it is large in depth of fruit and flavor, with black currants, earth and coffee reigning on the palate and into the finish. A sensuous texture and long finish with soft tannins complete the pleasure package. Very approachable; drink now through 2008.",94,50.0
1833,Iron Horse,"Great depth and purity of fruit. It shines with lovely violet and lavender accents. Very dark cassis, black plum, coffee and toasty oak flavors, with handsome herb and spice accents. The mouthfeel is excellent—big, but almost perfectly balanced between lush richness and solid tannic structure. A keeper needing four to six years.",94,35.0
1834,Kendall-Jackson,"Rarely does a Cabernet of this quality carry the basic ""California"" appellation, but here it does, and who should care? Deep black fruit with perfect oak makes for the ultimate in integration. A long cocoa and spice finish closes the show. Wonderfully sweet, round and delicious.",93,60.0
1835,Concha y Toro,"Plum, berry and raspberry aromas are light and elegant. This feels medium to full in body, with tannins that grab a little but don't clamp down. Ripe black-fruit flavors of plum and currant finish with an herbal note of basil along with flavors of oak and tomato sauce.",90,25.0
1836,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Blue flower, exotic spice and dark berry aromas take shape on this full-bodied glossy red. The structured enveloping palate offers dried morello cherry, raspberry, star anise and pipe tobacco alongside compact fine-grained tannins. It already has so much to offer but will be even better in a few years. Drink 2019–2029.",90,40.0
1837,DFJ Vinhos,A selection of old vines has given an intensely structured wine. It is packed both with tannins and concentrated black fruits. The density of the ripe fruits show how well the wine is maturing. Drink from 2017.,91,50.0
1838,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Black fruits are wreathed in subtle notes of earth, smoke and graphite. This is a palate-pleasing wine, but seems a little too safe, lacking the complexity and northern Rhône accents that Washington Syrahs often show.",88,35.0
1839,Wines & Winemakers,"Perfumed and lightly spicy, this is a Sauvignon Blanc that brings out the tropical fruit side of the grape. With its rich fruit and soft citrus, it is smooth and ready to drink.",85,15.0
1840,DFJ Vinhos,"Pure Touriga Nacional, this is a crisp and fruity wine. Its red currants and light tannic structure give it shape and bring out the fruitiness that makes it immediately attractive. Ready to drink now.",85,10.0
1841,DFJ Vinhos,"Green plums and ripe apples bring out the best in Arinto's range of flavors. This is a soft wine, with light acidity that's well integrated into the rich fruitiness. Drink now.",85,8.0
1842,Siduri,"Burnt tea, forest floor and crushed leaf aromas ride atop dense layers of turned earth and stemmy rose scents in this intriguing wine from a beloved site. Moderate acidity keeps it fresh, highlighting its succulent black cherry fruit with lavender and Asian spice notes that emerge on the finish.",93,55.0
1843,Lynmar,"This is a round, rich wine full of fig, vanilla and salty oak flavors. Bright, lemony freshness and a stony, mineral-like quality accentuate its texture and complexity, lasting long into the finish.",93,60.0
1844,Georges Duboeuf,"This crisp, tangy wine is packed with citrus flavors. Brightly textured with a mineral edge, it is fruity, hinting at spice along with a floral, fresh character.",87,22.0
1845,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"From outlying vineyards in the Côte d'Or, the heartland of Burgundy, this wood-aged wine is full of red currants and attractive, easy acidity. With a touch of spice and a juicy aftertaste, it is ready to drink.",86,19.0
1846,Foxen,"There's a style to this Pinot that takes some understanding to appreciate. Its cranberry, pomegranate and rhubarb flavors are complex, highlighted by brisk acidity and minerals. The result is an elusive wine, low in earthy elements and immensely satisfying. This is one for the cellar. Best after 2019.",94,62.0
1847,Lynmar,"This wine is a standout in an outstanding portfolio of 2013 vineyard- and block-designated wines from this producer. Five Sisters is big and burly at first, a fistful of leather and Asian baking spices that demands notice. Then subtlety takes over in lithe, sinewy waves of blueberry and blackberry, followed by a touch of licorice on the nearly endless finish.",97,100.0
1848,Bründlmayer,"Right now, this feels like a compact parcel of closely packed fruit flavors, held tight by citric freshness and yet it offering glimpses of what is to come: there is a hint of yeasty savor, but also a textural element reminiscent of apple peel. The citrus notions are promises of tart grapefruit, tangy orange, ripe tangerine and the purest lemon. There is something definite and astute that stands with an absolutely straight backbone, just waiting for its time to arrive. It will be spectacular. Drink from 2019.",96,64.0
1849,Feudi di San Gregorio,"This pure expression of Merlot opens with enticing scents of red woodland berry, crushed flower, smoke and exotic incense. The silky, structured palate boasts a range of flavors, including juicy wild cherry, raspberry jam, licorice, tobacco, vanilla and cinnamon, while velvety tannins offer seamless, polished support. It's already elegant and thoroughly delicious, but it will age well too. Drink 2018–2028.",96,105.0
1850,Lynmar,"From mighty Kanzler comes this ripe, densely tannic wine, plush like candy, it's a celebration of black cherry, dried herbs and vanilla oak, rewarding in its nod to hedonism in balance. The minerality is pronounced and persistent, allowing the wine to breathe. Drink now through 2023.",95,70.0
1851,Foxen,"This is a big, ripe, full-bodied Pinot Noir—as big as the variety gets in California. But it never loses balance, by virtue of the brisk acids, silkiness and dry finish. This wine always impresses for its sheer, Incredible Hulk volume. Drink now–2015.",92,58.0
1852,Chanson Père et Fils,"This is rich and ripe, with just a touch of wood influence. It has a tropical fruit and lime flavor, with lemon zest acidity. It is full, very structured and mineral, adding the complexity of ripe fruit. Age for 3–4 years.",92,81.0
1853,Louis Latour,"This is a taut wine, touched by yeast and warmed by ripe yellow fruit. Flavors of melon and spice from the new wood give it an open feel. It's ripe, already rounded and full bodied.",92,90.0
1854,Louis Latour,"This is a structured wine with rich, concentrated fruits. It has a strong mineral content along with a tense texture. Tropical fruit flavors come through on the rich, opulent finish.",92,70.0
1855,Gary Farrell,"Shows the Farrell mark of elegance, with balanced ripeness and acidity. Bigtime flavors of pineapples and tangerines mingle with caramelized oak, with additional buttered toast and vanilla richness. A crowd-pleasing Chardonnay that shouldn't be consumed too cold.",87,32.0
1856,DFJ Vinhos,"A rounded wine with spiced pear and citrus fruits, this is juicy and full bodied. A touch of textured minerality gives a sense of structure. It's still young and needs aging. Drink from 2015.",90,11.0
1857,Kendall-Jackson,"A pretty good everyday Merlot, made from all-coastal grapes, not from the Central Valley. The cherry, blackberry and plum flavors are nice, the tannins are smooth, the wine is totally dry. The one negative is a sharp, minty green streak.",84,19.0
1858,Wines & Winemakers,"Attractive and herbaceous, this has an apple flavor that's laced with a citrus note. Fresh and crisp, it's fruity, forward and can be consumed now.",86,
1859,Testarossa,"Very stony and chalky sea-shell aromas arise off of this bottling that also benefits from lemon curd and plump Anjou-pear fruit on the edges. A tingling acidity and steely structure frames the palate, where delicate flavors of Key lime and more lemon curd add depth to the tension.",92,48.0
1860,Testarossa,"This bottling opens with clean and light yet pure aromas of peach blossoms, beeswax, rounded nectarine and sharper Granny Smith apple-skin notes. The palate is very high-toned and pithy with flavors of pear skin, Key lime, chive, sea salt and a touch of smoke, leaving the mouth with quite a sizzle on the finish.",92,48.0
1861,Columbia Crest,"For some reason, the budget-priced Two Vines Chardonnay lags its pricier siblings by a vintage or two. It's beginning to flatten out as a result, the freshness fading, though the fruit is still there and it is a pleasant effort, with some buttered apple flavors dominant.",86,8.0
1862,Testarossa,"Testarossa is better known for Pinot Noir, but their Syrahs, and particularly those from Garys' Vineyard, are some of the best around. This 2009 is delectable now for its sheer drinkability. It's rich and luscious in blackberry, blueberry, smoked meat, pepper and earthy tobacco flavors, wrapped into smooth, complex tannins.",94,54.0
1863,V. Sattui,"This is a fleshy Cabernet, with meaty, olive notes to the blackberries and black currants. It's nicely dry and tannic, the kind of Cab that needs a rich steak to tame the astringency. Should develop over the next 5–6 years, at least.",92,50.0
1864,Siduri,"Raw-boned, aggressive in tannins and powerful in fruit, in the manner of a young Garys' Pinot. While it's not ready to drink, it does show commanding flavors of black cherries, currants, cola and mushrooms that aren't going anywhere anytime soon. Try drinking it after 2016.",92,52.0
1865,Testarossa,"This is certainly one of Testarossa's best 2011 Pinot Noirs. The winery purchases most of its fruit, but in this case, the vineyard is co-owned by Testarossa, and winemaker Bill Brosseau had complete control in the vineyard. The wine is gorgeous, complex and ageable. Beyond the exquisite raspberry and blueberry fruit is a mineral-derived savoriness that makes it firm in the mouth. Gorgeous now, this single-vineyard wine should age well for at least 12 years.",94,60.0
1866,Testarossa,"If the first duty of a wine is to offer pleasure, then this wildly succeeds. It shows the power of great Santa Rita Pinot, with superb balancing elegance. As sweet as the raspberries and licorice seem, the wine finishes dry and crisp in acidity, and even with some bracing tannins. Beautiful now, it will continue to evolve for 10 years.",94,60.0
1867,Testarossa,"This single-vineyard wine feels light and silky in the mouth, like the passing of a cloud. Yet incredibly ripe cherry, raspberry, strawberry and cola flavors give it weight and importance, making it sweetly delicious. Brilliant acidity provides balance, suggesting pairing it with barbecued steak. But there's also as guarantee foraging as you can get in a California Pinot Noir. Should still be gathering steam in 2023.",94,67.0
1868,Testarossa,"This is a reserve-style bottling based on barrel selections of the winery's extensive portfolio. It's extravagant in tangerine, mango, peach and oak flavors, with leesy notes of yeast, new oak and buttered toast. With brisk acidity, it's a rich wine that should be enjoyed now.",93,59.0
1869,Testarossa,"One of Testarossa's best 2011 Pinot Noirs, of 14 released, this wine is, in a word, gorgeous. First off is the silky texture, as airy as a cloud. Then there are the flavors, complex and lush in raspberries, cherries, brown sugar, cinnamon and oak. The wine is so delightful to drink now, you might miss out on cellaring it until 2018 to see where it goes.",93,62.0
1870,V. Sattui,"A Grenache-driven blend with 28% Syrah and 9% Mourvèdre, this is a substantial, concentrated wine generous in leather, pipe tobacco and blackberry pie, accented teasingly in clove. With a big, meaty presence and long, grippy finish, it should stand the test of cellaring, through 2020.",90,36.0
1871,Concha y Toro,"As per usual, Don Melchor is singing a pretty tune. Deep, dense aromas of floral berry fruits and tarry darkness are solid and complete. Pure, elegant and confident across the palate, this delivers firm cassis, plum and cherry flavors backed by a toasty finish accented by licorice. This is rich and brawny but not heavy; drink through 2023.",93,125.0
1872,Siduri,"Fresh raspberries, red cherries and even blackberries arise on the juicy nose of this wine from Adam Lee, but it's lifted by wild mint, hummingbird sage and damp coyote scrub. The palate is very herbally spiced, with thyme, marjoram, black cardamom and charred pine, laid across dried strawberries, cranberries and sour cherries, all tied together by serious grip. Drink 2019–2025.",93,60.0
1873,Siduri,"All types of tea, from black to nettle to Greek mountain to chamomile, show on this wine's herbally powered nose, with bits of sagebrush and wild berries thrown in for good measure. Tea elements also power the palate, along with cranberry fruit and raspberry leaf, held together with grippy tannins, at least for this grape",93,55.0
1874,Wines & Winemakers,"Full-bodied and ripe, this is a rich, generous wine that shows complexity as well as subtle fruitiness. A blend of Viosinho and Verdelho, it's full of tropical fruit flavors, with ample weight and concentration. Spicy accents, a dense texture and a fine, long-lasting finish are all part of this stylish wine.",90,18.0
1875,DFJ Vinhos,"The full juiciness of Castelão is balanced by spice and structure from wood maturation. The result is a smooth, textured wine, firm with tannins for aging. It is rich, smoky, dry and edgy at this young stage. Drink from 2016.",90,15.0
1876,DFJ Vinhos,"This is a firmly structured, dark wine. It has black cherry and berry fruit, a solid core of tannins and tight acidity. With its dense character, there is every chance of this impressive wine aging well, yielding a more rounded wine. Drink from 2016.",90,9.0
1877,Trapiche,"Bold aromas of cola, forest floor and minty blackberry lead to a muscle-bound palate that's more ripe and saturated than outright hard. Oaky, chocolaty berry flavors are dense, while oak-based flavors of maple and woodspice take over on the finish.",89,20.0
1878,Robert Mondavi,"It's Pinot-esque in the cherry and raspberry flavors and light, silky tannins, which make for easy drinking. Crisp acidity boosts the flavors and adds zest and life. Certainly a simple wine of little depth, but will suffice for an inexpensive Pinot Noir.",85,13.0
1879,Kendall-Jackson,"From coastal counties between Mendocino and Santa Barbara, a nice, supple wine that has plenty of Pinot character. Don't expect depth or ageability, but this black raspberry-flavored wine has soft, silky tannins and a spicy finish.",85,14.0
1880,Testarossa,"From up in the Chalone highlands, this is a fruity wine, filled up upfront flavors of cherries, raspberries, cola and spices. The structure is simple, with silky tannins and decent acids supporting the flavors without establishing any great depth or complexities.",85,50.0
1881,Montes,"Herbal and spicy, with some rubbery notes to the nose and a bit of pickle to the flavors. The plum fruit on the palate is round and peppery, while the wine finishes warm and full. Decent fruit but not rich.",84,10.0
1882,Undurraga,"Aromatically, this coastal SB from a cold, wet year is caught between citric and vegetal. On the palate, this feels tangy but that's about it. Salty, green-leaning citrus flavors finish strong, although that's not necessarily a ringing compliment.",87,22.0
1883,Casa Santos Lima,"This wood-aged wine shows dark berry fruits and a dusty structure. That goes with the juicy fruitiness that is perfumed, fresh and spicy. The wine has a stalky aftertaste with plenty of acidity. Drink now.",85,10.0
1884,Casa Santos Lima,"The wine is smooth, soft and juicy. It has a fine balance, ripe with berry fruits and light with acidity and a easy-going texture. The oak aging has served to smooth any tannins, leaving a wine that is ready to drink.",85,10.0
1885,Testarossa,"Very light aromas of apricot and apple blossom show on this appellation blend by the single-vineyard specialists, whose winery is based in Los Gatos. A nice touch of acid marks the palate, where lemon zest meets with ripe Pink Lady apple flavors.",87,38.0
1886,Montes,"Punchy, mildly herbaceous aromas of olive, herbs, tobacco and plum are classic Chilean scents. This cool-vintage Malbec is lively and a bit raw on the palate. Savory, roasted, oaky flavors of minty blackberry and plum finish dry, hot, peppery and ultimately a touch salty.",87,23.0
1887,Casa Santos Lima,"Structured, this oozes blackberry fruitiness as well as a balanced layer of dry tannins. The wine is fruity and rich while keeping its elegance. A core of tannins and fresh acidity in the fruit promise that this wine will age. Drink from 2017.",92,26.0
1888,DFJ Vinhos,"Hand-selected bunches from the Porto Franco estate of DFJ Vinhos went into this complex wine. It has solid tannins and a firm black-fruit character. The wood aging shows well and is already balanced, melding the fruit and structure together. Drink now.",92,25.0
1889,Testarossa,"The cool weather of the Sonoma Coast has made for an acidic, somewhat minty wine. It has some good flavors of cherries, and is elegantly structured and bone dry, but may not have the stuffing for the cellar, so drink now.",87,54.0
1890,Concha y Toro,"Dense in color, with earthy, crusty aromas of baked berry, moss, tobacco, cola and cassis. Feels lush, meaty and deep, with tobacco, balsamic flavors, baked blackberry and chocolate. Mellow, lightly herbal and smooth on the finish; hits all the high marks. Drink now.",91,38.0
1891,Concha y Toro,"Clean aromas of banana and apple get this Chardonnay off to a solid start. The palate is alert and upright, with a note of resiny oak. Flavors of melon and peach are supported by snappy acidity.",87,11.0
1892,Santa Ema,"Aromas of saline solution and sawdust accent generic citrus and apple aromas. On the palate, this is fresh and citrusy. A blast of sharp lemon, apple and quince flavors come before a lightweight but oaky finish.",86,15.0
1893,Maryhill,"This is made in a dark, rich style, with the lush vanilla and tobacco flavors that can be found throughout this winery's red wine lineup. Here, the plummy fruit has the density to match the oak treatment.",87,17.0
1894,Maryhill,"This Grenache, Syrah, Mourvèdre blend has a tart and tangy appeal. The mixed plum and berry fruit flavors are matched with strongly herbal streaks. Tannins are earthy and astringent.",87,32.0
1895,Testarossa,"Here's one of Testarossa's more forward Pinots from the 2011 vintage, but that appeal is deceptive. It's rich and ripe in raspberry, strawberry and cola flavors, with an apparent sweetness that belies the dry finish. The acidity is adequate, giving it a tart softness. Yet the parts have not come together. Give it until 2017 and see what happens.",92,60.0
1896,Columbia Crest,"All coming from Block 95 of the winery's estate vineyard, this is a beguiling wine with a complex range of notes that include caramel, spice, squash and cream. It shows excellent balance, length and finesse, with the enjoyment as much about mouth-feel as flavor.",91,20.0
1897,Gary Farrell,"A prominent amount of new French oak shows on this Chardonnay in the form of buttered toast and caramel notes, with intense fruit notes that ultimately balance out the oak. The vineyard is in the warmest part of the Russian River Valley, and the wine is deliciously ripe in peaches and tropical fruits. Ready to drink now.",91,45.0
1898,Casa Santos Lima,"This is a smooth, ripe wine with just enough tannin to give it structure. The main character is rich, full of black plums and blackberries—ripe and generous. It has a wonderful juicy aftertaste.",88,11.0
1899,Albert Bichot,"Crisp apple flavors show strongly in this wine that offers good acidity and a tight, lively aftertaste. The brightness pushes the citrus character forward, leaving a lively, refreshing aftertaste.",88,40.0
1900,Georges Duboeuf,"This wine is ripe and full, with a soft, creamy character that is warm and smooth. A light brushing of toast brings out spice. This attractive, rounded wine is ready to drink now.",88,43.0
1901,Georges Duboeuf,"Structured and dense, this has a solid feel to it that still preserves its attractive, fragrant character. Black plum notes provide a twist of acidity as well as a perfumed finish.",87,
1902,Trapiche,"Aromas of bath oil, candle wax and lychee set up a chunky palate with tropical flavors of lychee and melon. This blend of Torrontés and Chardonnay is round, plump and just acidic enough to hold its own.",84,13.0
1903,Trapiche,"Fleshy peach and melon aromas comme off as chunky and soft. The palate is just as soft as the nose, with melon and banana flavors. A simple finish is friendly but lacks spine, so drink this Chardonnay before it loses steam.",84,10.0
1904,Lynmar,"This is from a cool, southeastern corner of the large Sonoma Coast AVA. In this cool vintage, you can taste the fog in the crisp acids and dense tannins. Not a fruit bomb like so many others. Instead, a very dry, serious Syrah that requires patience. Such is the action-packed core of blackberries and currants that this wine should evolve over the next decade.",92,36.0
1905,Casa Santos Lima,"This is a really soft wine with the minimum of tannins and the lightest fruit. It has just a hint of crisp, clean red berry fruits. Drink now.",83,10.0
1906,Wines & Winemakers,"Made from the Códega do Larinho grape (also called Síria), this is a refreshingly rich wine. It's full in the mouth yet it retains its natural freshness, with a touch of pepper, tangy acidity and great depth of flavor. The finish bears notes of citrus, pear and green apple.",88,15.0
1907,Albert Bichot,"Mouth-watering in its bright, pear juice freshness, this is a crisp and lemony wine, touched by cream with a tight texture layered by wood. The acidity is crisp, dominant.",88,
1908,Trapiche,"Char, sawdust and black cherry aromas confirm the wine's “oak cask” labeling. Full bodied and ripe, it conveys meaty thickness and bold flavors of berry and spiced plum. A toasty, charred finish is lifted by bright acidity and fresh black-fruit flavors. This will go well with just about anything off the grill.",88,10.0
1909,Chehalem,"An exemplary rendition of the RR reserve bottling, this vintage is loaded with honey and spice. Smooth, off-dry, complex and full bodied, it's in perfect balance between sweetness and tang, mixing fruit and skin components with that succulence. Lively and energetic, it's delicious now but will benefit from age. Drink through 2030.",93,39.0
1910,Williams Selyem,"Showing just a touch of reduction, this wine is bright, crunchy and explosive on the palate. The palate shows a mix of raspberry, cherry and cranberry that's full of flavor. Seductively smooth, it should continue to evolve and expand with time, as the wine is just beginning to unravel its complex notes of baking spice, vanilla and tea.",93,72.0
1911,Wines & Winemakers,"A blend of Fernão Pires and Arinto, this fruity wine is deliciously refreshing and crisp, with great acidity. It is bright with lemon acidity finished with pink grapefruit. Drink now.",86,12.0
1912,Maryhill,"The reserve takes the tight focus and black fruit flavors of the regular Cab and ramps them up a notch or two. Deeper, denser and darker, with flavors of cassis and licorice wrapped into the tannic, earthy depths of the finish. This has great power.",91,30.0
1913,Chehalem,"Light in color and in the fruit flavors that are front and center, this tastes of straightforward cranberry and raspberry. It's pleasant but on the simple side, and its tannins bring a touch of green flavors as it wraps up with a gentle suggestion of milk chocolate.",89,50.0
1914,Gary Farrell,"From an Olivet Lane-situated site, where Pinot Noir is its likely neighbor, this head-trained vineyard is planted to a heritage selection put in the ground in the 1920s. It sings in black licorice and juicy black cherry, showing a tightness of texture and medium build, buoyant in acidity. This is a likable, complex wine with traces of dried herb that linger.",92,50.0
1915,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"This is 100% Cabernet Sauvignon from the Cold Creek vineyard. Smooth and fruit forward, it's done in a seamless, accessible, ready-to-drink style that makes it difficult to put down. A fair amount of vanilla flavor comes through, accenting a consumer (and consumption) friendly style.",88,30.0
1916,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Labeled dry, this nonetheless carries a hint of sweetness, at 70 g/L residual sugar.  It's fruity and fresh, with melon, citrus and peach prominent. A perfect summer sipping wine.",88,10.0
1917,Fess Parker,"From the renowned vineyard's F Block comes a wine with plump wild berries, pencil lead and juniper on a tightly woven nose. Certain to last for years and evolve steadily over that time, the palate now shows lavender, elderberry, elderflower, cranberry essence and a touch of black tea. Drink 2018–2028.",90,55.0
1918,Fess Parker,"Dark strawberry fruit meets with rustic earthy aromas and light allspice notes on the nose of this wine from the late actor's family-owned winery. The palate shows boisterous and tart cranberry and black raspberry fruit, with pencil lead minerality and great energy, if not a ton of complexity.",90,55.0
1919,Columbia Crest,"Merlot (64%) and Cabernet Sauvignon (34%) makes up the majority of this wine, which is topped off by smidgens of Cabernet Franc and Malbec. The aromas of raspberries, black cherries and milk chocolate are generous, while the palate brings a sense of smoothness and balance.",90,35.0
1920,Santa Ema,"Balsam wood, floral berry and herbal aromas rest in front of a crisp, fresh palate with raw acidity and clampy tannins. Olive, pepper, herbal and foresty fruit flavors announce a medium-weight, snappy finish with no obvious oak. This is very nice but at $125 a bottle it has its limits.",89,125.0
1921,Albert Bichot,"The fruit here is attractive, pears and white currants on top of pink grapefruit and orange zest. It shows its structure and its tense minerality only slowly, allowing the acidity to give it a lift and vibrancy. This is a wine that is still young, still smoothing out its hard edges.",91,47.0
1922,Santa Ema,"Big and saturated is the best way to describe this mammoth blend of Cabernet, Carmenère and Cab Franc. It's full of ripe fruit, coconut and cassis on the nose. Next up is a pure, bulky palate of raspberry, plum and vanilla. There's some sweet, resiny oak notes if you dig deep, but overall it is a high-end, structured red blend. Drink now through 2012.",91,37.0
1923,Kunde,"More useful than rich, this Cab is dry and full-bodied, with blackberry, black currant, herb and smoky oak flavors. Drink now.",86,22.0
1924,Gary Farrell,"This fine, small-production wine is fermented and aged predominantly in concrete egg—the better to preserve and promote its beautifully crisp, briny green-apple and pear flavors. Its sharp acidity acts as a squeeze of lemon, making it all the more satisfying.",91,60.0
1925,Albert Bichot,"Very concentrated and closed up, like a coil. The intense green fruit is followed by plum skins. Crispness, dry but fresh, comes alongside a powerful explosion of flavors.",92,65.0
1926,Williams Selyem,"Shows young vine jamminess, with fresh, ripe raspberry, cherry and cola flavors. The Williams Selyem balance of acids and tannins of dry elegance is evident, as is the new oak. Complex and supple, this wine needs time in the bottle to show its best. Give it until 2008, and should drink well for years beyond.",92,54.0
1927,Louis Latour,"Lively, fresh and crisp, brightened with citrus flavors. White currant fruits burst out of the wine, leaving an aftertaste of crisp steeliness.",87,
1928,Georges Duboeuf,"Opulent and ripe, full bodied and rich, this has notes of toast and spice as well as apricot and pear flavors. With its balanced character, it can be consumed now, but it will also age for another year.",88,25.0
1929,Kendall-Jackson,"Good winemaking lies at the heart of this wine, which also blends in smidgens of Cab Franc, Petit Verdot, Merlot and Malbec, the grapes from a range of estate-grown sites. Balanced fruit and dusty tannins accent a generously expansive palate that is rich but not overly concentrated, shining in berry, cherry and mocha tones.",90,28.0
1930,Kendall-Jackson,"There's tremendous value in this well-made wine. It's savory in its mix of dried herb and plum notes, with smooth, softened tannins and judicious use of oak that lends richness to the palate. It'll appeal broadly.",90,23.0
1931,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"This 100% varietal from one of the state's oldest vineyards brims with aromas of dark roasted coffee, char, bittersweet chocolate and black cherry. Flavors show plenty of concentration and depth with a lingering, cocoa and vanilla-filled finish.",91,30.0
1932,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Aromas of matchstick, herb, vanilla and cinnamon are followed by a creamy-feeling palate that equally mixes fruit and barrel flavors. The tannins seem a bit bunched up.",87,18.0
1933,Fess Parker,"This off-dry bottling shows orange blossom, light honey, tangerine rinds, lemon zest and the slightest hint of petrol on the nose. There is decent zip to the palate, where orange-soda and lime flavors ride a sugary frame.",87,15.0
1934,Wines & Winemakers,"Ripe and smooth wine, with a rich Port-like aroma, the sweet fruit structured with some fresh stalky tannins. Great herbal and wild berry flavors to finish.",89,10.0
1935,Chanson Père et Fils,"A delicious, mineral structured wine, very pure. The acidity is a great layer going through the textured white fruits, the wood just there as a subtle support.",89,65.0
1936,Santa Ema,"A rock-solid wine with bright currant, berry and rooty, cola-infused aromas. The mouthfeel is excellent and integrated, with earthy, savory, spicy flavors of blackberry, cherry and tea. Long and savory on the finish, with complexity. Wines like this are what make the Chilean Carignan category worth exploring. Drink now through 2012.",90,27.0
1937,Foxen,"Very dry and very crisp, with lime, lemongrass and mineral flavors. Considerable new French oak brings creamier notes, while 15% Viognier in the blend adds an exotic tang. It impresses for dry, zesty elegance. An interesting wine, and one to watch in future vintages.",89,25.0
1938,Foxen,"Drier and more minerally than Foxen's other Chardonnays, because it is the least oaked. It's vibrant in grilled pineapple, mango, apricot and vanilla spice flavors, brightened by beautiful acidity. Alcohol is quite high, but the wine never tastes hot or unbalanced.",92,32.0
1939,Kendall-Jackson,"Concentrated and slightly dried red cherry meets with cola on the nose of this densely packed, heavy-bodied bottling. The palate shows very dried red fruit with a touch of nutmeg spice.",86,26.0
1940,Lynmar,"With no new oak, La Sereinité is indeed serene, textured and round with vibrant acidity. The aromatics do the talking first, inviting one in with nuanced white peach, orange blossom and lime before the palate develops over time into richer, fuller flavors of crème brûlée. Throughout, the wine is balanced and expressive.",92,70.0
1941,Albert Bichot,"This wine is dense, although you hardly notice the tannins for the weight of concentrated fruit. The tannins are there, though, a power to thrust this immense wine well into the future. It is well formed, firm while rich. Drink from 2024.",96,530.0
1942,Albert Bichot,"This massive wine is powered by dark, concentrated and smoky tannins that are masking the fruit. Dry and dense, it will take many years for the black fruits behind the facade to develop. Drink this intense wine from 2025.",95,385.0
1943,Chanson Père et Fils,"Initially showing considerable wood flavors, this wine hints at its rich fruit through its weight and concentration. Spice, toast and beautifully ripe yellow fruits are slowly coming together and will harmonize with time to showcase a rich, opulent and impressive selection. Drink from 2022.",95,200.0
1944,Kunde,"The wine brims with pineapples, Asian pears and papayas, dusted with every spice in your pantry. It's bone dry, with a crisp bite of acidity. A touch of oak and lees gives it a rich edge of cream and buttered toast.",88,17.0
1945,Wines & Winemakers,"Made from old vines, this ripe and firm wine is young and still developing. It has black fruits that are lifted by the juicy, concentrated acidity. Structure, spice, pepper and a generous, full palate all point to some aging. Drink from 2017.",90,35.0
1946,Gary Farrell,"This is bright in notes of apple blossom, lemon and lime, with additional hints of mineral and oak. Developing in the glass, it offers flavors of grapefruit and lemongrass from middle to end, while the finish is lightly marked by a honey accent.",90,45.0
1947,Columbia Crest,"Aromas of fresh, savory herbs are in the lead, followed by plum, vanilla and dark fruit. The black-fruit flavors are elegant with a firm squeeze of tannins backing them up. It needs time to come together but has all the stuffing.",90,40.0
1948,Concha y Toro,"We haven't seen anything labeled Trio for years, but the return of this Concha y Toro brand seems solid. Aromas of orange blossom, lime and other green fruits are good, while flavors of citrus, grapefruit and cucumber are fresh and appealing. A good but standard wine that is lifted by a touch of green herb and brine.",86,14.0
1949,Undurraga,"Fresh but not overly racy, with apple and pear aromas. There's ample snap and pop to the palate, but not a whole lot of body or specificity of flavors. That said, the tastes of lemon and green apple are clean albeit shallow, and the finish is more of the same. Drink now.",86,12.0
1950,Wines & Winemakers,"With strong wood-aging flavors, this is a full, very ripe and concentrated wine. Coming from old vines, it has depth of flavor, both fruity and rich. Peach and pear flavors dominate, along with spice from wood aging. The wine needs some aging, so drink from 2015.",91,19.0
1951,Kendall-Jackson,"Frankly sweet, this Riesling, made only from cool coastal grapes, benefits from crisp acidity. The tartness balances the sugary peach, citrus and honeysuckle flavors.",83,10.0
1952,V. Sattui,"Reduced and extracted, this old-vine wine is smooth and velvety, powerfully made to reflect rich, ripe red berry and a layering of brown sugar. The finish is lean and reminiscent of black licorice.",90,47.0
1953,Casa Santos Lima,"A wine from the Santos Lima home estate, the wine brings together two noble varieties in a homogenous, smooth blend. The tannins that are part of the DNA of both grapes have been softened by wood aging so that the dominant character of this ripe wine is almost refreshing, juicy acidity. Drink now.",90,26.0
1954,Lynmar,"Briny, with a taste of salted kettle corn, this offers a nice balance between an edgier, more savory character and the fine-tuned minerality that extends into the finish as bristles of Meyer lemon and wet stone. The aromatics reveal an inviting touch of orange peel and lemon custard.",91,55.0
1955,V. Sattui,"Thick and heavy, with flavors of raspberries and cherries. The wine has an earthy texture more reminiscent of a Syrah, and finishes with mouth-numbing tannins.",84,35.0
1956,Robert Mondavi,"This wine's grapefruit and lemon flavors are lean, showing too much tartness and heat.",83,11.0
1957,V. Sattui,"Very rich and fruity, yet it tastes pretty sweet. If you enjoy a candied blackberry flavor, this could be for you.",85,65.0
1958,Albert Bichot,"Fruity and attractively wood aged, this is soft and round, with a bright edge of acidity that brings out the taut, refreshing finish.",85,16.0
1959,DFJ Vinhos,"The wine is rich, bringing together two great white grapes. Both give the ripe smooth texture, while the Alvarinho also brings in its crisper charms. Pear and green-plum flavors dominate this intense and concentrated wine. Drink from late 2017.",89,12.0
1960,Georges Duboeuf,This single vineyard wine is powerful with its concentrated tannins and dark cherry fruits. Good acidity goes with the fruit and the dry core. A shame that a hint of banana spoils the aftertaste.,88,
1961,Columbia Crest,"Despite the wine being fermented and aged in 100% new French oak, the fruit shines through, with notes of corn silk, peach and tropical fruit accented by barrel spices. Texture and richness to the sweet fruit flavors keeps interest high.",90,20.0
1962,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"The aromas on this wine are light and nuanced with notes of pear, butter and pineapple. It's full bodied in feel, clean in style showing good weight and viscosity while retaining a pleasing sense of lightness.",90,20.0
1963,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"This is a lightly smoky wine from vineyards in the hills behind the Côte de Beaune. It is spicy with a touch of wood as well as red-cherry fruitiness. The wine needs to age a few months, so drink from late 2018.",87,
1964,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"The chalk soil of the appellation is reflected well in this tangy, mineral wine that shows hints of the wood aging in large barrels, which rounds out the crisp fruits and gives a pinch of spice. The wine is still young and will be better from 2017.",89,66.0
1965,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"With the velvet texture typical of the appellation, this smooth wine offers a good balance between the red fruits and soft tannins. A smoky edge mingles with the berry-fruit acidity to give a wine ready to drink from 2018.",89,50.0
1966,Wines & Winemakers,"The wine is dusty, dry with layers of fruit that are still developing. Blackberry fruitiness is embedded in the firm structure of this stylish wine. It has a delicious, juicy aftertaste. Drink from 2017.",89,12.0
1967,Foxen,"There's something transformative about Foxen's winemaking. This smells of smoldering clove cigarettes, set against concentrated pomegranate and cranberry juice. The flavor follow an impressive arc, with Bing and sour cherry sliding into savory Italian herbs. It ends with a tongue-tickling wash of light yet coating tannins and bright acidity.",93,64.0
1968,Lynmar,"This offering comes from a two-acre parcel of Quail Hill Vineyard, the coolest pocket of the site. Earthy, herbal and savory, it's seamless in black cherry, clove and plum. A bite of acidity enlivens the palate before a finish of tannin and oak.",93,70.0
1969,Foxen,"Cranberry and clove swirl into a decadently spiced nose on this single-vineyard expression from veteran winemakers Dick Dore and Billy Wathen. The wine delivers more complexity on the palate, with touches of raspberry, allspice and cardamon.",93,62.0
1970,Williams Selyem,"This classy young Pinot is the second release from the winery's only Petaluma Gap vineyard. It's bone dry, mouthwateringly tart in acidity and delicate in structure, with complex cherry, cranberry, persimmon and cola flavors, nicely augmented by smoky oak. You can drink it now, after decanting for an hour or two, and it will soften a bit, or hold until 2020.",92,55.0
1971,Fess Parker,"This bottling from neutral barrels is reserved on the nose, showing dust, light red fruit and earth aromas. The flavors are equally light, evoking red mulberry fruit and turned earth. Clean and quaffable, but not very exciting.",87,55.0
1972,Testarossa,"Hearty and thick aromas of raspberry, mulberry and sugar plums meet with a touch of bay leaf on the nose of this bottling from a famous vineyard. Woody and dark red fruits show on the sip, with juniper and sour cherry flavors most prominent.",91,65.0
1973,Maryhill,"Supple and inviting, this mellow take on Cabernet Franc has soft cherry-pie flavors, a dash of pepper, and a smooth, chocolaty finish, with a pleasant, toasty, caramel aftertaste.",88,25.0
1974,Gary Farrell,"The vineyard is owned by the Farrells, and is located in the Green Valley, the coolest section of Russian River. The wine is very bright in acidity and clean and clear in minerals, with notes of tart lemondrop, brioche and Asian pear. Lees add a distinct taste of yeast and a rich, creamy texture. Perfect with cracked crab.",90,38.0
1975,Louis Latour,"Black cherry juice vies with a dense structure in this powerful wine. It has layers of tannins and sweetness. This is a firm, solid wine packed inside velvet. Age for 10 years and more.",93,425.0
1976,Louis Latour,"This wonderful, mineral wine boasts the ripe apricot and peach fruits of the year combined with a taut texture, well-integrated wood and a great waft of citrus to close.",92,85.0
1977,Chanson Père et Fils,"Showing austerity via its tannins, this is a severe wine despite its red berry fruit. It has layers of wood and a dry core. Age for six years or more.",92,95.0
1978,Concha y Toro,"A rich wine with ample barrel influence on the nose along with white fruit aromas. Healthy and big in the mouth, with a flavor profile that blends tropical flavors with citrus. Deep and lightly toasted on the finish, with an excellent feel and texture out the door. Noticeably less oaky than in the past.",90,35.0
1979,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Barrel-forward aromas of vanilla and toast are in front of herb and cherry. The palate brings a sense of polish and appeal, with the tannins bringing some squeeze on the finish.",90,30.0
1980,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"This wine displays all of the intensity of expression of Cold Creek. Aromas of toasty spices and pear are light but lead to a full, rich-feeling palate, with the acids providing a perfect counterbalance.",91,25.0
1981,Chehalem,"This delivers a bit of extra grip and weight compared to the widely-available Three Vineyard bottling. Pear and peach fruit flavors are lightly toasty, leading into a full-flavored midpalate and a medium-long finish.",89,28.0
1982,Undurraga,"This is bold and bullish, but also acidic and raw in feel. The opening berry aroma conveys a wild side, and the mouth is racy and grating, with the feel of fruit skin and flavors of plum and cherry. This captures the rugged, hard-core side of Maule Carignan.",84,25.0
1983,Robert Mondavi,"The Moscato-sipping crowd will like this wine. It's crisp and off-dry, with honey, tangerine and vanilla flavors, plus zesty acidity.",84,11.0
1984,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"This is a very perfumed wine, full of red fruits and hedgerow berry flavors cut with some firm tannins. It has an aromatic character that is typical of Chambolle-Musigny, a soft, warm texture that is developing behind the tannins. It needs to age, so drink from 2018.",88,102.0
1985,Louis Latour,"There is some solid structure here, along with a tannic edge that marks out a wine for aging. This has plum skin and a dense texture that brings out a richness as well as the acidity that marks the vintage. It should be aged; drink from 2017.",88,80.0
1986,Siduri,"Made from a selection of high-end vineyards otherwise sourced for single-vineyard wines, this is a stellar offering and a steal of a deal for the quality, a mix of funky, lightly spiced dark plum and black cherry that's unfussy in its approach. Mouthcoating, it'll please a wide range of palates and meals.",88,32.0
1987,Williams Selyem,"The Allen bottling typically needs time to come around. This '06 shows the dusty tannins that close it down a bit in its youth, suggesting a good five years in the cellar. Silky and refined, it should evolve to a fine wine, with its cherry pie, mocha, cola and spice flavors. If you drink now, decant. Beautiful with a fine grilled steak.",93,78.0
1988,Kunde,"Locked down by hard tannins, this nonetheless is a beautiful Zinfandel, dry and rich in flavor. It bursts with savory wild berry, tobacco, mocha and pepper flavors, and feels elegant and refined. The tannins call for enormously rich beef, pasta, sauces and cheeses.",92,35.0
1989,Siduri,"Deep smells of sagebrush, cherry and herbed mushroom sauce lead the nose in Adam Lee's take on Rosella's Vineyard. The wine is rich and soft on the palate, with sour cherry, roasted tomatoes and a slightly bitter, tannic finish framed by espresso. Serve with thinly sliced roasted beef.",91,50.0
1990,Kendall-Jackson,"Fresh, lively and brimming over with fruit flavor, from lemon to lime to peach. The appearance is light gold, the aromas are very immediate and effusive, the texture tangy and the finish light with a hint of sweetness.",87,13.0
1991,Siduri,"The vineyard is in the Chehalem Mountains AVA, though the label simply reads Willamette Valley. Light toast and dark fruits abound, with black cherry, char and roasted-coffee flavors leading the charge. Utterly delicious, this is a fine single-vineyard offering from Adam Lee. The barrel aging is subtle and complex, with a hint of coconut in the finish.",92,50.0
1992,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"This wine is rich, firmly structured while also full of dense black fruits. It comes from one of the top premier-cru vineyards in the appellation, well situated halfway up the slope, facing east. The wine will develop slowly as the ripe fruit comes through the structure. Drink from 2021.",92,113.0
1993,Louis Latour,"From the highest point in the Meursault vineyards, this wine is crisp and cool. It has a tight, bright character that is driven by the steely, mineral texture. The grapefruit flavors go with the riper apple and pear roundness to give a wine that will take a little time to develop. Drink from 2018.",92,85.0
1994,Wines & Winemakers,"Getting past the heavy bottle, you find a structured and firm wine that has aging potential. Dark and firm, with rich black-plum flavor and a concentrated texture, the wine is developing into a ripe, impressive wine. The mineral edge will integrate well over the next year. Drink from 2018.",92,22.0
1995,Montes,"Warm and mulchy at first; this is a muscular, dark wine despite the bargain price, and it's tight, tannic and herbal but serious in weight, structure and depth. The palate shows creamy, oaky, herbal fruit in front of a full, grabby, tobacco-accented finish. Elevated size and structure is what brings it up a notch.",87,13.0
1996,Chanson Père et Fils,"This wine is rich, sweet, extravagant and, finally, elegant. Its ripe fruit flavors, red plums, sweet strawberries and smoky acidity all work together. The wine shows considerable concentration, but never loses sight of freshness. Age for another five years at least.",93,90.0
1997,Chanson Père et Fils,"A beautifully perfumed wine, all herbs and smokiness. The palate sings the same tune, a rich, sensuous one, laced with more somber notes of dark, dry tannins. At the end of the day, this is already a delicious wine, but one that will really improve over 5–10 years.",93,75.0
1998,Albert Bichot,"Spicy, smoky Lapsang Souchong tea aromas, pure acidity and juicy red plum flavors are all here in this big, but finely structured wine. The tannins are an essential part of the shape of the wine, but act as a support for its richness. The finish brings out the lively acidity of Pinot Noir. Age for five years.",93,
1999,Chanson Père et Fils,"This is a fruity wine with lively acidity and a brisk, zingy character. Freshness shoots through the wine, making it lively with hints of yellow fruits. The aftertaste is crisp and ripe.",89,36.0
2000,Concha y Toro,"Punchy citrus and minerally aromas open this fresh SB. A juicy, citric palate points in the right direction, while this tastes like tangerine and orange peel mixed with lime and green herbs. A crisp, persistent finish closes it out.",89,17.0
2001,V. Sattui,"This is a fully oaken, reserve-level wine with decadent yellow wax that's concentrated and ripe on the palate in toffee, vanilla and baked apple pie. Robust, it drinks decadently.",89,47.0
2002,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"Even in a fruity year, Pommard lives up to its reputation for firm tannins. This wine will have delicious ripe black fruits, although not just yet. The structure and the dark tannins are up front, leaving tantalizing hints of the richness to come. Drink from 2019.",89,68.0
2003,Trapiche,"Compared to the 2004, this wine seems less generous. The nose is solid, with licorice, spice, pepper and plum fruit. But the palate is kind of flat and bland, with plump but dull raspberry and strawberry fruit. For $30 you want more.",84,30.0
2004,Trapiche,"Big and black but also heavily charred and very oaky—we're talking bulldozer oak that leaves mostly resin and vanilla on the palate. Combine that with huge tannins and extract, and what should be pleasant and fruity becomes a stampede across the palate.",83,12.0
2005,Lynmar,"This wine sings in the glass, offering substantial aromas and flavors of charcuterie, dried herb and orange creamsicle, conjuring up visions of picnics in a glass. It will do well in such settings, but is also a worthy addition to the table, balanced and structured to pair memorably with a wide range of foods.",91,25.0
2006,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"Aromatic hints of baked Cox Orange apple and ripe pear are accented by aromatic overtones of ripe quince. Quince also shimmer on the dry, even slender palate that shows uncommon spice and and clarity. A pure expression of Pinot Gris, this is shaped by freshness and zest.",91,26.0
2007,Testarossa,"A delicate and light nose of red-cherry fruit picks up hints of smoked pork and flecks of forest floor on this botttling from a historic vineyard in a small appellation. Red cherries also show on the palate, where touches of oregano and graphite make fo a versatile wine that's easy to like.",91,64.0
2008,Santa Ema,"This Carignan from Cachapoal is one of Santa Ema's best wines year in and year out. This vintage is woodsy and dark on the nose, with boysenberry jam and shoe-polish aromas. It's tannic and powerful for sure, with flavors of ripe tomato, graphite, black plum, herbs and even salt. A rugged, briny tasting finish confirms the inherent rustic character of Carignan. Drink through 2019.",91,27.0
2009,Kendall-Jackson,"Delicious, almost sweet fruit flavors are wrapped in firm, velvety tannins for a seriously enjoyable experience. There's a feeling of polish in the texture, and careful balance between full body, good tannin structure and lively acidity.",91,17.0
2010,DFJ Vinhos,"A perfumed, ripe wine, attractively flavored with citrus, peach and melon, this is a wine for drinking young, a warm day wine, or as an apèritif. The crisp structure adds to its mouthwatering character.",86,13.0
2011,Chehalem,"A superstar in this new vintage, this wonderfully concentrated and well-delineated wine offers precise fruit flavors of etched and sculpted peach, apricot and melon in perfect proportion. There is ample acidity under the 19 g/l residual sugar.",93,29.0
2012,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"Slight yeasty funk still hangs over the nose. The palate immediately comes in with driven force and incredible energy. There is pith and zest, stone and smoke, but for now the fruit is hidden at the core. Great concentration adds to the drive and dynamic here. This is warm and ripe, but still incisive—it's not showing its true colors yet. Drink 2020—2030.",93,55.0
2013,Fess Parker,"This bottling from the historic vineyard boasts a balanced, smoky quality on the nose that pairs well with its sharper white flower and salted nut aromas. Its acidity and tongue-tingling texture on the palate is addictive, revealing ripe Gala apple flavors backed by lemon juice, sea salt, oak and wet stone notes.",93,40.0
2014,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"The 2011 vintage is a high-water mark for the Indian Wells Chardonnay, principally because the oaky, buttered popcorn flavors have been muted. It's a firm, slightly tart mix of green and yellow fruits, with supporting acids and excellent length. Pleasantly toasty, but not over the top.",90,17.0
2015,Testarossa,"Earthy aromas of clay and wet slate meet with tangy red fruit on the nose of this bottling, which is a best-barrel blend. There is expert acidity and nicely polished tannins, with dark berry flavors along with more slate-driven earthiness. Relatively mellow and reserved for a top-tier effort.",91,87.0
2016,Albert Bichot,"Rich, deliciously fruity and ripe, this combines warmth with a more mineral undertow that cuts through the palate, creating a wine that is refreshing and mouth-filling. It would be worth aging for two years or more.",87,20.0
2017,Foxen,"Acidity and minerality lend this Chardonnay a distinctive personality. The cool vintage has given it a certain lean appeal, but that's not to minimize the tropical fruit and sweet oak that give it richness. It's sleek, stylish and moderate in alcohol.",92,37.0
2018,Georges Duboeuf,"Simple and fruity, this has berry flavors that mingle with floral acidity, soft tannins and a rounded texture. Ready to drink.",85,
2019,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Always a wine that shows a powerful oak influence, this new Indian Wells seems soaked in buttered popcorn flavor. The finish comes out a little bitter, with little fruit flavor to round it out.",85,18.0
2020,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"This was a difficult vintage in Washington, and the style of this dry Riesling seems to have changed significantly, perhaps as a result. The grapefruit flavors have no body or texture; it's light, certainly refreshing, but rather simple.",85,9.0
2021,DFJ Vinhos,"A fresh, slightly sweet rosé, that keeps crispness through its bright, breezy strawberry flavors. The wine is soft, crisp, clean, a summer rosé.",84,8.0
2022,Chehalem,"The Stoller-sourced Pinot is forward and ripe, with pretty fruit flavors in a compact, light vintage. Cola, peach, black cherry and milk chocolate components swirl together, fading gently into a light finish. Drink over the next 2–3 years.",88,50.0
2023,Columbia Crest,"Straightforward, this offers thin, tart fruit with excessive vanilla and tobacco flavors. There's no residual sugar, but otherwise it's right out of the Australian playbook.",84,8.0
2024,Santa Ema,"Aromas of pear, citrus and almond should be familiar to anyone who knows Chilean Chardonnay, but to call this wine elevated or beyond regular would be a stretch. The palate is slightly lemony and green, and the finish has a persistent tang. Seems like basic Casablanca Chard to us.",84,9.0
2025,Concha y Toro,"Bold and saturated to the eye, with black fruit, olive and other slightly herbal aromas. But where this wine loses points is in the mouth. It's sharp and overtly acidic, which makes the cola and cherry flavors ring and seem tangy. Thus it finishes short and scouring.",83,12.0
2026,Foxen,"An exciting wine, dry and silky with balanced restraint Overall, the power is evident in the controlled explosion of cherries, currants and cola, wrapped in firm, smooth tannins. A great success, and worthy of extended cellaring. Begin to drink this beauty after 2018.",94,65.0
2027,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Coming from a warm site in a cool vintage, it's an intriguing wine with notes of freshly cut hay, peach and mango.  It's lighter in style, with the partial malolactic fermentation (60%) providing extra weight and feel.",89,30.0
2028,Georges Duboeuf,"This wine, solid and dense, is full of firm tannins as well as red cherry fruits. It's also fruity, with a great juicy character that permeates right through the wine. For drinking now, but better kept for 2–3 years.",89,
2029,Georges Duboeuf,"An elegant wine, its berry fruits fitting well into a structure that balances tannins and soft acidity. It has style, the fruit full of sweet black berry juice and a lift of acidity.",90,
2030,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"In 2009 this single vineyard offering includes 11% Sémillon. It has wonderful texture, and a mix of light herbal flavors that run through a gamut from celery to lemongrass and up into tart citrus fruit. The acidity is generous but not searing; it penetrates but never overpowers. A quintessential food wine.",90,15.0
2031,Siduri,"Generous on the palate, this wine from the famous site is ripe with wild strawberry and pomegranate fruit and accented with the distinct spiciness of cardamom. It displays its youth through assertive tannins and oak-derived scents, layering the thick finish with cinnamon bark.",91,50.0
2032,Trapiche,"Brawny, toasty aromas prop up a sturdy oaky nose with a familiar dark-berry core. This Malbec is tightly wound, with wiry acidity. Flavors of blackberry, cassis, spiced plum, chocolate and cardamom finish earthy and mellow, with a lingering note of exotic spice. Drink through 2022.",91,45.0
2033,Foxen,"Delicate aromas of raspberry, sagebrush and white pepper make for a lighter yet complex expression of Pinot Noir from this estate vineyard of Richard Longoria, who's a regional veteran like the Foxen owners. Tart and taut flavors of black raspberry, pepper, oregano and leather combine for a very earthy experience, which is simultaneously subtle and stunning.",94,70.0
2034,Albert Bichot,"The wallled Clos des Ursulines is wholly owned by this producer. This perfumed wine is showing strong wood aromas as well as concentrated spice. Underneath, the generous juicy fruit has a fine balance between red plums and bright acidity. Drink from 2022.",94,79.0
2035,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"From one of the parcels that make up the larger Corton Grand Cru, this is a powerful wine with a proper sense of its dignity. It is stylish as well as rich—an elegant blending of ripe red fruits, tannins and acidity. The wine of course has great potential and will not be ready to drink until 2025.",94,
2036,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"This firmly structured wine is packed with solid tannins as well as ripe juicy red fruits. It comes from the upper part of the Rugiens Premier Cru, one of the top sites in Pommard. Dense and needing to age, the wine will be ready from 2023.",93,103.0
2037,Louis Latour,"Rich and rounded with a creamy texture, this wine is ripe with apricots and has a strongly mineral character. Full of fruit, the wine also has a texture that means it needs to age. Drink from 2021.",93,90.0
2038,Louis Latour,"Among the most northerly of the run of Beaune premier crus, the wine is structured but the structure is cushioned by the ripe red-berry fruits to give a generous wine. Backed by tannins, the wine will age well. Drink from 2022.",93,80.0
2039,Wines & Winemakers,This blend of Arinto and Fernão Pires is soft and bland. Its light fruit and acidity feel open and ripe.,84,12.0
2040,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"A fragrant wine, it offers truffle and red fruit aromas. The palate is ripe although it does have intense acidity, more bright red fruits than firmer structure. It feels almost ready to drink, fruity and fresh.",88,148.0
2041,Maryhill,"Coming from the cool 2011 vintage, this vineyard-designated wine doesn't seem entirely ripe, displaying notes of herbs, cranberry and red fruit. It's screamingly tart with moderate fruit flavors and abundant oak accents that lead to a warm finish.",85,32.0
2042,Maryhill,"Sourced entirely from the Milbrandt vineyards, this shows little in the way of either varietal character or ripeness. There are indications that some of the fruit was raisined, while some was green. A lot of tobacco, vanilla and oak flavors cannot mask the thin finish or herbal tannins.",85,17.0
2043,Maryhill,"This is an exceedingly light for a Cab with a reserve designation. It's also astringent, with flavors of vanilla and cut tobacco overtaking the thin fruit, and a finish that resolves in bitter coffee grounds.",85,25.0
2044,Maryhill,"The fruit is thin and herbal, with light hints of plum. The tannins take over quickly, chewy and earthy. This is for those who like a lot of stem and herb flavors in their Syrah.",85,17.0
2045,Siduri,"Black pepper and orange rind complement one another aromatically before riding a medium-bodied layering of soft, seductive texture and acidity, additionally highlighted in rhubarb and black tea. As the wine builds complexity in the glass, it shows a minerality marked by earthy mint on the finish.",92,49.0
2046,Lynmar,"Full and roundly lush, this is a big, bold wine from a specially selected site within an estate vineyard. It imparts smoked meat alongside rich, spiced plum, an undercurrent of rosemary and herbes de Provence whipping in between the fruit and generous tannin.",92,80.0
2047,Gary Farrell,"Kind of tutti-fruity and candied, with Lifesaver flavors of cherries, raspberries and blackberries. Easy to like, with a quick, spicy finish. Drink now.",87,50.0
2048,Albert Bichot,"Soft, jammy, forward wine, that exhibits sweet strawberries, a generous structure, and only light tannins. Drink now.",86,
2049,Testarossa,"A worthy followup to the '05, possibly even richer and more balanced. Shows wonderfully crisp, mouthwatering acidity framing fruit that's so pure, it's like the essence of pineapples, mangoes, limes and green apples. Lots of oak is here, too, and the smoky, spicy vanillins add just the right touch.",93,39.0
2050,Fess Parker,"Rich red cherry, rust, smoke and crushed gravel aromas show on the nose of this bottling from the historic vineyard. Smoked meat, lavender and rose petal notes play with cranberry, pomegranate and hibiscus flavors, creating a pleasant mix of delicate and savory elements.",92,58.0
2051,Wines & Winemakers,"There is something of the essential crispness and green fruit character of a Vinho Verde. But the wine also has some richness, weight, and a creamy texture. Very aromatic, this is a wine to drink and also age a few months.",90,15.0
2052,Lynmar,"Brine and oak accents cradle this impressive wine's elegant green apple, wet stone and lime notes. Bold and concentrated yet complex, it's balanced by lively acidity and persistent freshness.",95,55.0
2053,Lynmar,"An inviting hint of butter shows on the nose of this big, bold and concentrated wine. It displays craftsmanship through its embrace of lightly toasted oak, which accents vibrant apple and pear notes. It's lushly textured, with persistent acidity and a lemon peel flourish on the close.",95,60.0
2054,Gary Farrell,"This head-turning wine was made from vines planted in the 1970s and 1990s—a selection that shocks with its complex beauty. Pine forest and Christmas spice notes accent cranberry, rhubarb and tart citrus flavors, all seemingly infused with seductive smoke. At its juicy core is an earthy, mushroomy component.",95,75.0
2055,Lynmar,"With its high-toned sparkle of lemon zest and orange, this lovely wine evolves to show rich oak and apple pie notes, evoking baked Gravenstein apple, cinnamon and nutmeg. Medium-bodied, it wears its concentration of flavor and texture well, finding a well-earned balance through the lengthy finish.",95,55.0
2056,V. Sattui,"This 100% Cabernet shows the deeply concentrated fruit and powerful yet refined tannins of Mount Veeder. It's packed with black-berries and black currants, with plenty of new French oak. Flashy, but needs time. Should easily unfold over the next 8–9 years.",93,49.0
2057,DFJ Vinhos,"Perfumed and bright, this is an attractive blend that includes Pinot Noir and Syrah. With its ripe creamy texture and exuberant red fruits, the wine is ready to drink.",86,10.0
2058,Louis Latour,"Crisp and fresh, this is a tangy, lemon and orange zest flavored wine. Lively acidity bursts through the richer white fruits, green plums and quince spiciness. Both fresh and ripe, it's well balanced. Drink now.",87,
2059,Louis Latour,"This is an attractive fruity wine, with a good touch of steely acidity as well as ripe yellow and white fruits. Sliced apples and fresh grapefruit give freshness. Crisp and clean, it is refreshingly ready to drink.",87,
2060,Robert Mondavi,"A bit soft and sweet, with a candied taste reminiscent of a pineapple and hazelnut fruit and nougat bar. The '06 Reserve is far better, though at twice the price.",84,20.0
2061,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"The aromas offer notes of vanilla, baking spice and tropical fruit. The flavors are light and restrained, pulling up slightly toward the finish.",88,20.0
2062,Chateau Ste. Michelle,Barrel notes of toast and spice intermingle with stone fruit aromas and flavors that show nuance. The flavors are light but the feel is compelling.,88,22.0
2063,Maryhill,"This wine, which is 100% varietal, is a blend of fruit from Art Den Hoed and Gunkel vineyards. Aromas of cranberry, clove and fresh flowers are followed by coffee and floral flavors that show elegance and persistence.",88,36.0
2064,Albert Bichot,"Rugiens,  which is named after its red soil, is located in the south of Pommard. Dense, structured and powerful, this is a brooding wine that has concentrated tannins and fruit that is offset by a tight line of acidity. This is a wine that demands aging.",91,
2065,Wines & Winemakers,"Made from fruit that's sourced from the Buçaco Mountains in the east of Bairrada, this wine is rich and elegant, and its juicy fruit provides a counterbalance to the structure. With its youthful fruitiness, this is worth aging for another 2–3 years.",91,11.0
2066,Louis Jadot,"Only a small portion of this vineyard is planted with Chardonnay, and it has produced a minerally wine that's both crisp and ripe. The acidity is dominant at this stage, which lends the palate a juicy, peach- and citrus-like character. This wood-aged selection needs time.",91,40.0
2067,Trapiche,"Narrow berry aromas are straightforward but not complex. This is a smooth operator with round tannins, plenty of body and a mix of black fruits, licorice, herbs and spices on the flavor profile. Flavors turn more herbal on the finish, where oregano and thyme accent tastes of cassis and berry.",89,15.0
2068,Undurraga,"Mature already, with aromatic notes of berry, lemony oak and root beer. The flavor profile is at first medicinal, but it opens to reveal cherry, chocolate and cassis. The chewy finish is aggressive and forward, and all told the wine is round if a bit candied.",86,25.0
2069,Concha y Toro,"The nose is fruity, with hints of vanilla bean. In the mouth, peach and lemon flavors carry a note of cinnamon spice, although the finish veers toward asparagus and green beans. Acidity and balance; are both on the money. Best Buy.",86,10.0
2070,Fess Parker,"From the former Ashley's Vineyard, which the Parker family sold a few years ago, comes this tough, acidic young wine. It shows a maritime influence in the dry tartness and bitter cherryskin flavors. Could be a sleeper.",88,58.0
2071,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Pure Cabernet Sauvignon from older vines, the Cold Creek bottling often begins life rather compact, even hard, and will usually benefit from some years of bottle age. This 2005 is a tough, somewhat stemmy wine, with tightly wound black fruits, herbs and leather wrapped into its core. Tannic and unyielding, even after some hours of breathing time, it is a bit too soon to know exactly how good it will ultimately become.",88,28.0
2072,Kunde,"This estate-grown white is consistently yummy, tangy in lemon peel and fresh-squeezed lemon, with a splash of fresh grapefruit. Dry and crisp, it finishes refreshingly, an ideal wine for light appetizers and most rewardingly, raw oysters.",88,17.0
2073,Testarossa,"This is a generous, tightly wound vineyard-designate that tastes more full-figured than it lists in terms of alcohol, jammy in dark plum and cardamom. It finishes with a ripe robustness of dark cherry fruit flavor and hint of earth.",88,64.0
2074,Kendall-Jackson,"Kendall-Jackson helped define the buttery oaky Chardonnay movement, and this bottling plays that card quite strongly. Oak meets with roasted nuts, sea salt, pecan brittle and Gravenstein apple on the nose. The rounded palate shows sandalwood, candied walnuts and chamomile, though oak is very prominent as well.",88,35.0
2075,Louis Latour,This is ripe and fruity with attractive red-fruit flavors and a touch of tannins to keep it all in place. The wine is soft with just a layer of tannin and plenty of red cherries at the end.,88,28.0
2076,Maryhill,"This wine is brightly aromatic, with raspberry, mint, herb and woodspice notes. The palate is full of plush, plump fruit flavors that provide appeal, despite the prominent alcohol.",88,40.0
2077,DFJ Vinhos,"A totally ready-to-drink wine that is full of bright red fruits and crisp acidity. It has some soft tannins and a dry edge, though the wine just bursts with fruit. Drink now.",86,10.0
2078,Georges Duboeuf,Banana flavors spoil this otherwise attractive and fruity wine. A dry core of tannins is surrounded by creamed banana and red fruits. Drink now.,84,13.0
2079,Georges Duboeuf,"With intense banana aromas, this is a tight wine with high acidity. It has crisp red-currant fruits that are not quite ripe. Tangy and shot through with banana flavors, the wine will be better from 2016.",84,
2080,Kendall-Jackson,"Serious Cabernet, rich and complex and full bodied, made from Knights Valley and Alexander Valley fruit, with a few grapes from Atlas Peak and Mount Veeder. Dense and tannic now, but high toned, with waves of black currants, black cherries and oak. A good price for a Cabernet of this quality. Drink now–2012.",91,30.0
2081,Louis Latour,"There is an explosion of ripe yellow fruit here, giving a ripe, tropical feel. Spice, mango, it's quite a powerhouse of flavors. This is a gorgeous, opulent wine.",93,255.0
2082,Albert Bichot,"There is an important element of wood here, along with a ripe, creamy texture. By contrast, the structure is mineral, lifted with grapefruit flavors. The wood supports this fruit, giving a complete, mouth filling wine.",93,
2083,Montes,"If you like a ton of oak, then this may be up your alley. Early aromas of tea and cherry quickly step aside as heavy, toasted wood notes take over. The palate is full and round, with weight, thickness and heavy berry and chocolate flavors. There's some Pinot character here, but put it on the scale and it's going to weigh out on the heavy side. To our taste, it's very New World and clumsy.",86,25.0
2084,Louis Jadot,"This soft, smooth and creamy wine has attractive spice and vanilla from the wood aging, along with light citrus and peach flavors. Ripe and full in the mouth, it has a touch of minerality at the end to give a fine texture. It is ready to drink.",87,18.0
2085,Louis Jadot,"This wine is fruity, with crisp, fresh lemon flavors. It is lightly textured and smooth, with green fruit acidity and a creamy aftertaste. Drink from 2016.",87,15.0
2086,Testarossa,"An earthy if slightly reserved nose offers mushroom and iron aromas on this bottling by the single-vineyard experts in Los Gatos. The wine comes alive on the sip, with bergamot, black tea, bay leaves, Greek spice and thyme decorating the woody elderberry fruits.",91,64.0
2087,Casa Santos Lima,"The wine is produced from old Alicante Bouschet and Sousão vines both of which contribute to the dark, almost black color. It is concentrated while with considerable acidity, tannins and a mouth- tingling juicy black currant character. The wood-aged, spicy wine needs to age much longer to even begin the round out, so don't drink before 2018.",91,40.0
2088,Wines & Winemakers,"This is a seriously impressive, ripe and powerful wine. Boasting rich fruits, black plum and berry flavors and concentrated acidity, it also has a dark, solid structure. Still young, this shows boisterous acidity and needs to soften and fill out further. Drink this fine wine from 2018.",91,55.0
2089,Undurraga,"Rustic smelling, this has a leafy scent and red fruit aromas akin to cherry and raspberry. The mouthfeel is tight, jumpy and alert, and the flavors of cassis and plum set up a rugged, scratchy finish, with notes of carob, vanilla and coffee.",87,25.0
2090,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Sweet spice, rum cake and dark plum open the nose of this dark and savory Primitivo. It is chewy and dense, with loads of ripe black-cherry flavor on the finish.",87,21.0
2091,DFJ Vinhos,"A perfumed wine that is soft and fruity. It has a fresh, tangy character that makes it very refreshing and crisp.Think of this as an apéritif rosé, bright and light.",85,9.0
2092,DFJ Vinhos,"Bigode, meaning the mustache, is fruity, fresh and light in texture. The juicy character needs another few months to integrate fully with the berry fruits. Spice adds interest. It will be better by the end of 2014.",85,8.0
2093,Fess Parker,"This blend of 53% Grenache Blanc, 34% Viognier, 10% Roussanne and 3% Marsanne, which features a painting by Santa Barbara artist Chris Potter, shows interesting touches of honey and orgeat with a macadamia nut backbone. The tinge of honey extends to the sip, where it joins baked apple, nectarine and peach flavors, along with a chalky texture and decent acidity.",88,20.0
2094,Fess Parker,"This is a simple wine, your basic country red. If it were from Italy, you'd drink it from a carafe, overlooking some beautiful scenery. Dry and tannic, it has earthy-berry flavors and a spicy finish.",83,12.0
2095,Montes,"This wine is flat and capped on the nose. On the palate, it's angular and narrow, with cidery flavors and little to no complexity.",82,23.0
2096,Lynmar,"Lots of zesty, crunchy acidity marks this wine, giving it a brisk mouthfeel. Beyond that clean dryness, you'll find complex raspberry fruit flavors, enhanced with sweet oak and vanilla. Drink this vineyard-blended, elegant wine now.",90,50.0
2097,Chanson Père et Fils,"Damaged by hail in 2013, the vineyards yielded low quantities. The grapes harvested produced a wine with crisp red fruits and bright berry acidity. The fresh, tight aftertaste suggests the wine will age. Drink from 2019.",90,68.0
2098,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"As with the Indian Wells Cabernet, winemaker Bob Bertheau is using a considerable amount of Syrah (19%) to beef up the flavors. The Merlot here seems a bit light, it fades out in midpalate. There is a chalkiness to the finish, and the tannins are just a little green.",85,18.0
2099,Columbia Crest,"This is a perfect go-to, everyday Chardonnay, solid and light, if a bit unexciting. The fruit flavors of apple and melon are gentle and soft, and the oak treatment delicately handled. You get a little bit of buttered popcorn, but it's not a night out at the movies.",85,8.0
2100,Wines & Winemakers,"This blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Fernão Pires is aromatic and ripe. Its fruitiness is tropical, with pineapple as well as apricot flavors. It's softly textured  and ready to drink.",86,15.0
2101,Testarossa,"Testarossa's annual best-barrel offering starts with broad aromas of violets, blackberry tea and anise on the edges. It's a lighter Pinot density-wise, very soft and expressive with purple fruits, black olive and a fennel-powered acidify on the finish.",90,81.0
2102,Fess Parker,"The nose on this Fess Parker study of barrel age is dominated by Christmas trees and eucalyptus, with subtle red fruit in the background. The palate is woody too, with tart cranberry amidst camphor, burnt cedar and spicy forest herbs. A very intriguing bottle.",90,55.0
2103,Santa Ema,"A little green and entirely basic, but in this price range it's not disappointing. The nose offers oregano, tomato and plum all in a savory wrapping, while the palate is lively and plummy, with no huge faults. Juicy as far as feel goes, with a bouncy red fruit-meets-herbal personality.",84,9.0
2104,Lynmar,"There's a surprising element of power to this Pinot Noir. Intense in dark cherry cola, clove and nutmeg, it offers a pronounced finish of wintery cardamom and caramel. The body is medium weight and the tannins smooth and silky.",93,60.0
2105,Lynmar,"Tense and full-bodied, Summit is from all Calera clone vines that deliver seductive elegance and earthiness. Cranberry and red currant follow aromatics of herb, dark cherry and classic Russian River cola spice. All the flavors develop further in the glass.",93,70.0
2106,Wines & Winemakers,"This is a floral, aromatic and dry rosé, full of red currant fruit and refreshing acidity. It's a great apéritif wine.",84,
2107,DFJ Vinhos,"This is a lightweight, fruity and softly tannic wine. The red berry flavor is bright and breezy, and the acidity is a dominant feature. Screwcap.",84,10.0
2108,DFJ Vinhos,"Fruity and off-dry, this has light touches of sweet strawberry and vanilla to go with the orange zest acidity. Screwcap.",84,8.0
2109,V. Sattui,"There's an unripe, green edge to this Zinfandel that detracts from its appeal. Yet it has some good blackberry fruit, and it's nicely dry and tannic. Pair this with rich meats and cheeses to coax out the sweetness.",84,35.0
2110,Wines & Winemakers,"Ripe and fruity, this bears a red berry flavor and a dry structure. It has weight, richness and a smooth finish.",84,
2111,Wines & Winemakers,"Crisp and herbaceous, this is a green-fruited wine that's light on the palate, offering delightful refreshing acidity. This is very fruity and ready to drink.",84,
2112,Wines & Winemakers,"The light prickle adds to the natural freshness of this lemon-sherbet-flavored wine. Very crisp and light in the mouth, this dances on the palate with just a touch of sweetness.",84,
2113,Montes,"Hickory smoked, campfire aromas lead off the nose, which has dense berry and curt minerality at the core. The palate is chewy, meaty and rich, with toasty, woody, spicy flavors of dark fruits and chocolate. Almost blackened at points, but undeniably from good grapes.",89,24.0
2114,Concha y Toro,"This is a heavily charred Syrah, so much so that its berry aromas are obscured by burnt scents. Compact and reduced in feel, this tastes of baked plum and blackened toast, with a rustic and roasted finish.",87,40.0
2115,Georges Duboeuf,"Broad, open wine with berry fruits, black cherries and a soft texture. The wine has freshness, plenty of acidity, for drinking now.",86,
2116,Trapiche,"Aromas of mocha, rubber, smoky leather and berry fruit indicate good things to come, but in the mouth this wine fails to deliver equal to its price and the previous successes of Trapiche's single-vineyard Malbec project. Scouring acidity is the main culprit; the wine seems clipped, tartaric and angular, thus it's all superficial and not deep or rich enough to rate better.",86,50.0
2117,Williams Selyem,"A dry, crisp Pinot Noir with interestingly ripe flavors of cherries, oranges and cola. Maybe a little overpriced for what you get, but it's a pretty wine.",86,34.0
2118,Santa Ema,"The aromas are meaty yet undefined. In the mouth, the fruit seems snappy and overly excited. The acidity is a bit out of control and it leads to questionable balance. Still the raspberry and cherry flavors are good, and the oak shadings seem about right.",81,9.0
2119,Concha y Toro,"Sweet, minty and confected, with marshmallow and candied berry aromas. The mouthfeel is tangy on the surface and hollow down below, while the palate has average size along with vanilla-infused berry flavors. Lean on the finish. More than 300,000 cases produced.",83,10.0
2120,Undurraga,"For a large-production wine (47,000 cases made), this is nice and easy to drink. Tropical fruit aromas are lightly citric. In the mouth, this is fresh and easy, with nectarine and tangerine flavors. Freshness and simplicity are this wine's calling card.",86,13.0
2121,Montes,"Nice and welcoming on the nose, with melon, citrus and other punchbowl aromas. The palate is graced with fine acidity, which amplifies the wine's standard green apple and lime flavors. Clean and showing no glaring issues. Textbook everyday Chilean SB; we could drink this stuff forever.",87,12.0
2122,V. Sattui,"The winery used to make an indifferent Pinot Noir from Carneros, but now they have some good fruit, and the improvement shows. The wine is delightful, with crisp acidity brightening very ripe flavors of raspberries, cola and black cherries, with lots of smoky oak. Drink this complex wine now and for the next few years. .",90,40.0
2123,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Cutizzi's bottle has been restyled with a single yellow polka dot that will really catch your eye. The wine is equally fetching to the senses thanks to its rich aromas of pear, peach and Golden Delicious apple. The soft creaminess to the mouthfeel begs for shrimp or shellfish.",90,33.0
2124,Siduri,"A good Pinot Noir, lusty, dry and fruity, although it's a bit raw in youth. Shows rich cherry marmalade, cola, spice and sandalwood flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. The vineyard is not among the valley's best, but Siduri interprets it as well as anyone.",90,50.0
2125,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"The full force of aromatic, dried pear rises from the glass, laced with dried apricot and candied peel. The pear fruit becomes exquisitely clear and pure on the palate, which is profound but slender. The wine is dry but powerful, holding at its core all the ripeness and fruit flavor from brilliant sunlight. It almost warms you from inside and goes on and on. Drink now till 2030.",94,80.0
2126,Louis Jadot,"This wine is dark and dense, very closed at this young stage. But wait for that rich fruit to burst out to give its intense acidity and ripeness to the wine. It's a powerhouse of flavors, spice and dark minerality. Drink from 2022.",94,133.0
2127,Louis Jadot,"This wine is dark, with a strong sense of structure. Dense black fruits are cut with strawberry acidity and a dark tension between fruit and firm tannins. The coiled power will allow this beautiful wine age for many years. Drink from 2020.",94,62.0
2128,Louis Latour,"Aged in 100% new wood, this massive wine is full of dark plum and fragrant strawberries. It is also packed with dark tannins that give the wine a dry core. The fruitiness has a strongly juicy character, fragrant with acidity and freshness. The end is a reminder that this is a powerful wine. Drink from 2020.",94,310.0
2129,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Smooth and supple, this five-grape Bordeaux-style blend is almost two thirds Canoe Ridge estate fruit from the Horse Heaven Hills AVA, the rest Cold Creek Vineyard Merlot. Lovely aromas of sandalwood, spice and cocoa lead into a textural wine, with seamless fruit and barrel flavors.",91,55.0
2130,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Barrel aromas are at the fore, with notes of vanilla, cocoa and milk chocolate out in front of blackberry and black cherry. The palate also mixes fruit and barrel, showing pleasing depth of flavors and intensity along with a silky texture.",90,18.0
2131,Columbia Crest,"Aromas of butter, vanilla, corn silk and tropical fruit lead to barrel-forward, oak-laden pineapple flavors that intertwine through the finish. For the style, it's well done but the oak is pretty intense.",90,26.0
2132,Columbia Crest,"The aromas are exuberant, with notes of lime, orange zest, ripe peach and flowers. The palate, as advertised, is bone dry with stone-fruit flavors that show crystalline clarity and linger on the finish that features plenty of lime accents.",90,28.0
2133,Siduri,"Eucalyptus, Bay laurel and other herbal aromas dominate the nose of this wine, making way for black tea and cola flavors. Full-bodied and robustly ripe with powerful tannin, it's ultimately earthy and complex.",90,55.0
2134,Albert Bichot,"Fresh and soft initially, this wine takes a while to reveal some mineral structure. But then, deliciously friendly white fruits surround this taut structure. The acidity is crisp, fresh, leaving orange zest and green fruits for the finish.",89,
2135,Montes,"Most 2006 Chilean Chardonnays are past their prime, but Montes Alpha still shows vitality along with rich aromas and flavors of pear, banana and barrel-driven toast. The feel is smooth and pure, while the flavors run straight to ripe apple, banana nut bread and buttered toast. Firm and holding steady on the finish, although it's probably best to drink immediately while the wine is still kicking.",89,26.0
2136,Fess Parker,"While this wine is clean and vibrant, it tastes off dry. With its honeyed finish and flavors of peach, nectarine and apricot jam, this is one of the most pleasant California Rieslings on the market. It's easy to drink with ham, sausage and slightly sweet Asian fare.",88,14.0
2137,Chehalem,"Young and sassy, this wine is already showing lovely nuances of toast, spice, lees and mineral. Complex, vivid and beautifully balanced, with a lot of fresh leesy texture and the tangy fruit riding on top. Classy winemaking, elegant and sophisticated.",91,32.0
2138,Testarossa,"Pomegranate and cranberry aromas gain complexity from wet slate and wild-thyme touches. The palate blends tangy fruit with earthy herbs, showing sage, dill, Earl Gray tea and fennel against a dried berry backdrop.",90,64.0
2139,Maryhill,"No information on blending was provided by the winery; this does not show typical character of truly varietal Grenache. Rather, it falls into the category of mutt wine; a ready-to-drink, nondescript red with a stiff, herbal, earthy finish.",83,26.0
2140,DFJ Vinhos,"Fresh red berry fruit and caramel aromas create a wine that is all sweet strawberry, highly aromatic and just touched by acidity. There's a definite softness, almost sweetness in the aftertaste.",83,8.0
2141,Wines & Winemakers,"This wine combines freshness and structure. It's full of acidity and bright berry fruits. At the same time, the solid structure gives the wine balance and a fine future. Wood aging offers further support to the fruitiness of this ageworthy wine. Drink from 2017.",88,18.0
2142,Wines & Winemakers,"A blend of four grapes, this structured wine shows big black fruitiness along with fresh acidity. It's still young, bright with acidity and needs time to round out. Drink from 2017.",88,12.0
2143,Santa Ema,"This golden dessert Sauvignon Blanc smells mature, with honeyed apricot and botrytis aromas. The palate is alert, bright and just sticky and honeyed enough, with apricot, quince and honey flavors. Juicy acidity on the finish keeps this from turning cloying.",88,18.0
2144,Foxen,"From a vineyard in the heart of the appellation comes this bottling that's redolent with hibiscus, Earl Grey tea, orange rind, black cherry, spiced plum and fennel bulb on the nose. The palate plays a bit lighter, with brisk cranberry, more hibiscus and lots of cola, proving quite light and easy to sip though well structured as well.",91,62.0
2145,Foxen,"Surprisingly shy in aromas at first, this eventually releases pleasing elements of mace, nutmeg, star anise and red cherry. The palate is softly lush and earthy, with black rocks, heavy black plum, hoisin sauce, boysenberry and a cola character. With quite strong structure, this will smooth and grow more delicious with time. Drink 2018–2028.",91,64.0
2146,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Dried peach, nectarine zest, flint and Mediterranean herb aromas characterize this stunning dessert wine from Campania. On the palate, fresh acidity brightens layers of candied ginger and lemon rind as well as honey and dried herb.",93,63.0
2147,Williams Selyem,"Located in the wilds of Annapolis, the vineyard will be familiar to fans of extreme Sonoma Coast wines. This vintage will be the winery's last from the site, according to the winery. Earthy cinnamon bark surrounds refined tannins and complex layers of high-toned cherry and raspberry before evocative dried herbs hit the palate.",93,59.0
2148,Kunde,"Lots of spicy Zin flavors in this affordable wine. It's soft and rich, yet dry, with briary blackberry, black currant, cocoa and spice flavors that finish with a warm headiness.",87,20.0
2149,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Serpico is a beautiful but also modern expression of Aglianico (the grapes come from ancient vines in the Taurasi area) that opens with dark notes of blackberry, crushed stone, chocolate, rum cake, licorice and cola. The mouthfeel is smooth, firm and very rich.",92,80.0
2150,Feudi di San Gregorio,"This is a gorgeous interpretation of Aglianico in which the tannic grape is softened and rounded out thanks to quality winemaking. Aromas of chocolate fudge, exotic spice, rum cake and loads of black fruit appear on the bouquet. You will, however, feel that characteristic tightness on the long, drying finish.",92,40.0
2151,Georges Duboeuf,"You can taste the wood in this red, fruity wine. It gives a spicy character to the cherries and red currants, adding both complexity and the potential for aging. The end shows the fresh acidity of the year.",88,
2152,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"The wine is fresh and crisp with a tangy texture that suggests a strongly mineral character. Slowly, a more creamy feel comes through, bringing out melon and pear flavors. Drink this attractive wine now.",85,22.0
2153,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"This is rich and surprisingly warm for the normally cool appellation of Pernand Vergelesses. It makes for an attractive, ripe and creamy wine that's been given a wood aging. But it doesn't have a sense of place.",85,54.0
2154,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (72%), Merlot (25%), Cabernet Franc (2%) and Malbec offers generous notes of chocolate, vanilla, pencil lead and dark fruit. It shows a nice interplay of elegant fruit and barrel flavors with vanilla taking the lead on the finish.",91,55.0
2155,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"This is a sweet and fruity wine, full-bodied and ripe. It has red cherries and bananas along with some acidity. While there are some tannins, it's meant for immediate drinking and not for aging,",84,22.0
2156,Georges Duboeuf,"Full of cherry and banana freshness, this is a simple wine that shows attractive fruit and acidity. It is good to go now, light, fragrant and bright.",84,15.0
2157,Louis Jadot,"A ripe, fleshy wine, full of cherry notes and spice. It is rich, full in the mouth while keeping a light fruitiness that allows it to develop fast. Overpowering banana flavors at the end spoil the overall effect.",84,14.0
2158,Santa Ema,"Jammy and flat up front, this blend of Cabernet and Merlot shows little vibrancy on the nose. In the mouth, it's blocky yet astringent, while flavors of berry fruits lean toward herbal. Tomato notes and tartness rise up on the finish, which is herbal and tannic in feel.",84,12.0
2159,Santa Ema,"High-toned red-berry aromas come with strong hints of herbs and olive. This has a choppy, somewhat astringent and tartaric feel. Acid-driven flavors of herbal plum finish mildly green, with a lasting note of olive.",84,10.0
2160,Kendall-Jackson,"This is a well-crafted wine that's dense and delicious in juicy red fruit, black currant, licorice and nutmeg. With much of the fruit sourced from the Alexander Valley, this wine shows a managed level of ripeness and oak aging. Structured and lengthy on the finish, this is a nicely put-together package.",91,28.0
2161,Iron Horse,"Tart cranberry, black tea and dark plum characterize this earthy, soft and supple wine, made from grapes grown in a block at the crest of a knoll. Firm tannins give it an edginess, an unexpected complement to its warmth and depth of cardamom spice and blackberry.",91,85.0
2162,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"Flinty reduction still dominates the nose but this is only a sign of youth in this nuanced wine. It discloses tentative pear blossom and fruit, plus notions of wet earth and candied lime. Above all, a zesty spine of acidity and freshness directs all the attention to a profound, stony core. There is life force here and you know this will continue to evolve.",92,55.0
2163,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"Flinty overtones of yeast reveal how very young this wine is. The verve that springs from the glass is undeniable. While the focus is on grapefruit and lemon zest in a tightly pulled focus, there are glimpses of honeycomb, popcorn, treacle, pollen and hints of tropicality, with a touch of pineapple. Hold this wine for a while longer and it will unfold itself graciously. Drink 2016–2020.",92,30.0
2164,Testarossa,"Almost as good as some of the winery's best single-vineyard bottlings, this wine has a tremendous nose that offers tangerine blossom, pink grapefruit skin, sea salt and toast around a line of graphite. The palate presents juicy nectarine and ripe citrus alongside yeasty sizzle, salt and a chalk minerality.",92,35.0
2165,Robert Mondavi,"A gorgeous Sauvignon Blanc, so rich and refined. It's almost as full bodied as a Chardonnay, with dense flavors of citrus and tropical fruits, gooseberries and minerals, but with that sleek, bone-dry, acidic refinement expected from this variety. Production was a mere 984 cases. Drink now.",93,40.0
2166,Trapiche,"Gorgeous balsam wood and graphite aromas blend seamlessly with ripe berry and black coffee scents. It feels lively yet cushioned, tasting like a wicked brew of maple, tobacco, berry pie and fine wood shavings. This is smooth, long and comfortable on the tobacco- and resin-flavored finish. Drink now–2018.",93,50.0
2167,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Aromas of pear, Spanish broom, flint and Mediterranean herb emerge in the glass. The juicy, medium-bodied palate offers ripe apple, peach and lime alongside fresh acidity and a mineral vein. A hazelnut note marks the close.",90,21.0
2168,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Heady aromas of citrus and orchard fruit almost jump out of the glass. The savory, medium-bodied palate tastes of ripe pear, mature apple and creamy peach interspersed with energizing mineral notes. Fresh acidity brightens the creamy flavors.",90,21.0
2169,Testarossa,"A nod to this winery being the 107th ever bonded in the country, this widely available bottling is a good deal. It opens with dried sage, tart cherry and pomegranate aromas, which lead into a light and airy palate full of cranberry fruit and garrigue notes, especially lavender and fennel pollen.",88,23.0
2170,Kunde,"A bit dull on the nose, this wine offers smoky, toasty blackberry and bacon around a soft body and short finish, making it fine for casual gatherings and barbecues.",84,20.0
2171,Williams Selyem,"The fruit is front and center on this oak-free Chardonnay. It's enormously rich in apricots, tangerines, pineapples, pears and lemons, with brisk acidity and a tang of minerals.",88,39.0
2172,Siduri,"This wine is bright and crisp in strawberry and red licorice flavors, with a depth of juicy plum that adds softness and velvety texture. Tawdry earth complements the exuberant fruit.",90,49.0
2173,Iron Horse,"Black licorice and orange zest star in this high-toned wine from a singular clone. It's moderate in acidity, with a strong presence of fresh lemon that lingers through the finish.",90,48.0
2174,Iron Horse,"With a clarity of fruit and minerality, this wine is brightly floral and noticeably stony, with highlights of melon, lemon and green apple.",90,27.0
2175,Casa Santos Lima,"Produced from vines grown in a boulder and fossil strewn vineyard, this is a rich smoky wine. It has a deep color from the Alicante Bouschet in the blend, with firm tannins and dark juicy plum skin flavors. It's going to be a ripe rich wine as it develops. Drink from 2017.",90,13.0
2176,Wines & Winemakers,"A powerfully constructed wine, it is packed with fruit and tannins. With a leather and spice character, it shows a dry texture while the black plum skin flavors are still developing. The future holds rich fruitiness as well as a solid, concentrated structure. Drink from 2017.",93,18.0
2177,Louis Latour,"In this generous and opulent wine, weight and richness accompany acidity and power. Ripe yellow and white fruits are given a touch of spice and new wood. It's gorgeous, but will be better after aging. Drink from 2018.",93,380.0
2178,Testarossa,"There's a touch of Riesling-like petrol to the nose of this best-barrels Chardonnay from Testarossa, as well as dried citrus, fresh roasted cashews and Chinese almond cookie. The palate is very soft, with ripe fruit such as baked oranges. A nicely buttered touch bolsters the refreshing, mouthwatering acidity.",93,61.0
2179,Testarossa,"The single-vineyard experts at Testarossa hit a homerun with this wine from a famed property. Aromas of 7-Up, recent rains and minerality kick off a refreshing experience, which is powered by a strong flavor combination of very ripe fruit (à la traditional California Chardonnay), barrel-related vanilla and brisk, lingering acidity (à la Old World).",93,45.0
2180,Casa Santos Lima,"This is a good example of a red Portuguese wine, showcasing soft, generous tannins and juicy red and blackberry fruits. It is ripe, full of fruit and rounded with a firm, dry aftertaste. Drink now.",88,20.0
2181,Casa Santos Lima,This rich wine comes from the far south of Portugal. It is structured and dense with black-plum fruit and firm tannins. Spice and grilled toast from wood aging and acidity gives this wine a good balance as well as ripeness. Drink now.,88,20.0
2182,DFJ Vinhos,"This wine has weight and considerable richness. Spice and an attractive perfume meld with the blackberry fruits and juicy acidity. The Castelão grape is at home in this region, which shows in the sense of terroir in this bold wine. Drink now.",88,10.0
2183,DFJ Vinhos,"Part of a series that showcases major grape varieties, this wine brings out the creamy, green and apple-fruit character of the Chardonnay. It conveys hints of tropical fruits and a ripe apricot flavor. Balanced acidity lifts all this rich fruitiness. Drink from late 2017.",88,13.0
2184,Concha y Toro,"Coconut and vanilla aromas announce new oak, and along with that there are aromas of blackberry and toast. In the mouth, tangy flavors sit on top of standard berry and spice, while acidity returns on what amounts to a lean, sharp finish.",84,26.0
2185,Louis Jadot,"The five acres of vines owned by Louis Jadot in this vineyard make this rich, bold, structured wine. Floral and intensely perfumed, with ripe red berry fruit, it's ripe while maintaining the intense acidity of the vintage. With all that power comes great longevity. Drink from 2026.",95,196.0
2186,Louis Jadot,"With its potent mixture of intense fruit and equally concentrated structure, this wine is an obvious candidate for long-term aging. Showing ripe yellow fruit, almond hints and a strong mineral texture, it will develop slowly and be best from 2022. This vineyard, one of the most familiar of Puligny-Montrachet's premier crus, is also one of the highest on the slope.",95,109.0
2187,Williams Selyem,"Textured vanilla-cream and green apple appear initially in this wine, which offers plenty of weight and structure around a core of balanced acidity and fresh lemon zest. Cardamom and vanilla play at the edges alongside elements of savory brine and white flowers. The oak presence is subtle.",92,58.0
2188,Testarossa,"Sweet, smoky oak marks this Chardonnay, lending it buttered toast and charred wood flavors that challenge the orange, apricot and pineapple fruit. It's an impressively powerful wine, if a little overworked.",87,32.0
2189,Trapiche,"Lime and floral notes create a light and breezy bouquet that's easygoing. In the mouth, it's juicy and fresh, with lemon-lime, peach, nectarine and lychee flavors. Tangy and fresh on the finish, and more precise and delicate than most Argentinean Torrontés.",88,15.0
2190,DFJ Vinhos,"A rounded wine, this gives pleasure with its pear and ripe apple flavors. Lightly touched with acidity, this has a soft finish.",84,9.0
2191,Testarossa,"Banana custard and charred marshmallow scents show on the nose of this bottling. The palate is similar, with charred brioche and cream pie flavors.",85,23.0
2192,Albert Bichot,"A wine that shows a more delicate side of the vineyard, as the texture is rounded and juicy. The structure is fully in place, hinting at licorice and black chocolate while pushing the red berry fruits forward. The final tannins are soft and open.",92,
2193,Louis Latour,"The wine is defined by its power and dense concentration. It shows solid black fruits, plums, fig and licorice as well as dark tannins. It seems a little austere at this young stage and needs several years to flesh out.",92,299.0
2194,Louis Latour,"Flowery and smoky aromas introduce a perfumed, ripe wine. Gentle at first, the tannins gradually show through, part of a solid texture that gives density. Fruit goes from damsons through black cherries and a layer of wild strawberry. For long-term aging.",92,229.0
2195,Louis Latour,"There is plenty of the proper power and intensity of a Chambertin here, resulting in a structured wine. It is dense, packed with black plum flavors, with a hard edge of spice and tannin. Obviously, there is a long-term future here, and it should not be touched for 5–6 years.",92,249.0
2196,Iron Horse,"This blend has 80% Viognier, which adds a peach and apricot streak that adds interest to the lemony, grapefruity flavors. Drinks tart, bone dry and clean, with sleek acidity. A terrific, elegant wine, perfect for a first course, and a great offering from this top producer. Editors' Choice.",90,19.0
2197,Montes,"Rich and aromatic, with a full blast of fragrant toasty oak and plenty of tropical fruit. The apple, mango and pear fruit that coats your mouth is round and ripe but not too thick or grabby. And the finish is perfectly smooth. Sure, it's a bit buttery and full, so no one will confuse it for Chablis. But in its class it's one of the best out there.",90,20.0
2198,Testarossa,"A very good wine while somehow failing to rise to expectations. Is it the vintage? All the elements are there, including ripe fruit flavors enriched with herbal and spicy complexities, generous acids and silky smooth tannins. Yet the wine is curiously New World flashy without offering nuance or depth.",89,50.0
2199,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"Mid gold color. Slightly muted aromas of ripe stone fruit. Sweet, light to medium-bodied with ample flavors of ripe fruit, peach pie, caramel, apple crisp and soft brown sugar. Fresh, with lively acidity and a smooth texture. Medium length with a sweet, spicy finish.",90,114.0
2200,Williams Selyem,"Sparkling wine from Williams Selyem? Yes, in tiny quantities, in this case only 100 cases. The wine is dry and rich in lime, raspberry, mineral and yeast flavors, but a little rough, lacking the finesse you want in a fine bubbly.",86,50.0
2201,Montes,"Sweet oak and toast are the lead aromas; underneath you'll find regular cassis and berry notes. The palate is healthy but low in depth and complexity. Tastes woody, spicy and infused with vanilla, while the fruit character is average and the finish a bit resiny.",86,12.0
2202,Louis Latour,"This is well balanced, ripe and with a good link between the structure and the fragrant, perfumed red berries. The wine is full of fruit and acidity while having a core of dark tannins that will allow it to age. It will be best drunk after 2018.",90,90.0
2203,Williams Selyem,"For drinking now, this red dessert wine satisfies for its soft, luxuriant texture, sweetness and depth of flavor. Offers blackberry jam, cherry marmalade, melted milk chocolate and smoky vanilla flavors accented with cinnamon, anise and pepper.",91,40.0
2204,DFJ Vinhos,"Round and smooth, this has a weighty, full-bodied structure, with the Alvarinho adding a more crisp character. Pear and melon fruits are balanced by citrusy acidity.",90,10.0
2205,Fess Parker,"Smoke meets game on the nose of this wine from a vineyard named after Fess Parker's late son-in-law, along with blueberry and asphalt aromas. The flavors are rich and dense, with blackberry, tart boysenberry and more smoked meat, proving the perfect pairing for hearty fare.",90,49.0
2206,Kendall-Jackson,"From the producer's line of wines meant to showcase higher-elevation sites, this one is almost all varietal, with small percentages of Merlot, Malbec, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Aged in both French and American oak, it impresses from the get-go, with intense notes of blackberry, black licorice and dark chocolate. It's dense yet balanced on the finish.",90,30.0
2207,Montes,"Except for some resiny oak, this wine is limited on the nose. It feels fleshy but balanced by citric acid, while the flavors include melon, pear and oak-driven spice. It's not too fruity, exact or minerally, but it will likely please fans of basic, casual Chardonnay.",85,12.0
2208,Louis Latour,"Definitely on the dry side, showing the tannic face of Pinot Noir. This is a serious wine that reflects its status as a premier cru, a powerful mix of cranberry fruits and dark tannins, but marked by a hot, hard aftertaste.",88,60.0
2209,Trapiche,"This is Torrontes in its pure, true form. Trapiche has captured the light, floral essence of the grape and wrapped it in an oily but smooth package that houses lovely green apple and papaya flavors. With structure, flavor and balance, this wine will go well with a wide range of summer foods.",88,17.0
2210,Kunde,"A terrifically flamboyant wine, filled with jazzy flavors that impress for their sheer hedonism. Peaches and pears veer way over to tropical fruits, and there's a lot of oak and lees to boot. The rich, creamy texture leads to a long, spicy finish in this young, delicious wine.",91,35.0
2211,DFJ Vinhos,"A fresh, bone-dry rosé, packed with acidity, red currants and a touch of caramel. The wine is light, summery, good for apéritif or food.",84,13.0
2212,DFJ Vinhos,"This is a featherlight red, full of berries and bright acidity, but with a texture that just coats the palate. This is one of those rare reds that works as an apéritif, fresh, clean and fruity. Screwcap.",84,7.0
2213,DFJ Vinhos,"It takes a while for the taste of this light, fresh white to come through. Then, it is soft, creamy textured, flavored with pear juice and lemon zest. It is simple, easy, cleanly made.",84,8.0
2214,Trapiche,"Dark, smoky black-fruit aromas include graphite. This is round, chewy and balanced on the palate, with ripe but standard flavors of cassis, blackberry and black pepper. Notes of burnt toast and char appear on a solid, ripe finish.",89,18.0
2215,Casa Santos Lima,"An elegant, understated wine that shows balanced red fruits, vanilla and touches of chocolate. Its attractiveness lies in the balance, with structure and acidity keeping the exuberant fruit flavors in check. Worth aging for 1–2 years.",89,11.0
2216,DFJ Vinhos,"The juiciness of Alicante Bouschet shows well in this full-bodied wine, packed with black berries and soft tannins. The dry finish suggests some aging—maybe 1 year.",89,16.0
2217,Casa Santos Lima,"Freshly aromatic, this is a Portuguese equivalent of a Gewürztraminer. It has all the lychees and spice as well as a thick, almost viscous texture. Good acidity helps the balance. Delicious, as an apéritif or with Asian food.",89,
2218,Wines & Winemakers,This is a soft ripe wine that has yellow fruits alongside crisper red apples and touches of grapefruit. That makes for a balanced light wine that has a fine texture and a fresh aftertaste. Drink now.,85,12.0
2219,Kunde,"This is appealing for its richness, but it's heavily oaked with buttered toast and butterscotch flavors that overwhelm the underlying fruit. Too bad, because it's a nice Chardonnay with bright pineapple and orange flavors supported by fine acidity.",86,27.0
2220,Georges Duboeuf,"At the moment, this is a tight, young wine with fruit that is masked. There is some potential that will give a wine with apple flavors. Wait to drink this until 2017.",85,25.0
2221,Gary Farrell,"This bottling is curiously at odds with the winery's other 2011 single-vineyard Pinots. It's less ripe, with a mushroomy earthiness alongside flavors of raspberries and pomegranates. You might call that Burgundian, but it does cut down on the wine's opulence, and seems to limit ageability.",87,50.0
2222,Georges Duboeuf,"This estate-grown wine has a really fresh character. With red-currant and red-cherry flavors, it has a juicy fruity style that is ready to drink. Light and perfumed, it is delicious now.",86,15.0
2223,Casa Santos Lima,"With partial aging in wood, this is a spicy, smoky wine that is also full of ripe red fruits. Its well-integrated tannins give shape to this wine. A crisp finish and the wine is ready to drink.",86,10.0
2224,Wines & Winemakers,"This ultrayoung wine is all fruit. It is textured with minerality and a chalky character that is keeping the fresh green fruits in balance. The wine is delicious, although really not ready. Better to wait until 2016.",88,20.0
2225,Feudi di San Gregorio,"White flower, citrus and exotic fruit aromas follow through to the juicy palate along with notes of toasted almond and mineral. It's vibrant and balanced, with brisk acidity.",88,20.0
2226,Kendall-Jackson,"Surprisingly rich and nuanced for such an inexpensive wine, it has balanced aromas and flavors of blackberries, pepper and earth. Has the finesse and complexity of red wines costing a lot more. —S.H.",87,9.0
2227,Kunde,"A rich, ripe Chardonnay, with tons of buttered toast, tangerine jam and vanilla flavors. Drink now.",84,17.0
2228,Trapiche,"This Grigio opens with mild lemon and apple aromas that transition into a flabby palate and dull flavors of buttercup, banana and apple.",83,10.0
2229,V. Sattui,"very tannic wine, with an astringent, dry mouthfeel, but it's so rich in fruit, it's enjoyable now. Floods the mouth with blackberry, cherry, plum, currant and dark chocolate flavors, edged with dusty spices. Should develop over the next six years, but if you can't wait, give it a good long decant.",91,44.0
2230,Albert Bichot,"Closed up and firm with a hint of vanilla, honey and refined acidity. There is some crispness here, green apples and a plum skin character. This is going to be serious Chardonnay; the minerality already in evidence.",90,
2231,Chehalem,"The goal here, says the winery, is to craft a wine that embodies the essence of Pinot Noir. Whatever that means, this is their priciest Pinot and the one that they have designated Reserve. It's got bulk and power, and I like the way it gathers strength in the mid-palate and on through the finish. It has pretty cherry fruit and good concentration; it does not have the textural detail of the single vineyard Corral Creek.",90,60.0
2232,Kunde,"Kunde has a remarkable consistency with their estate Viognier, and the ‘06 shows off the variety at its best. The wine is fully dry and very crisp, and avoids over-the-top flavors in favor of yellow citrus fruits, dates and spices. Try as an alternative to a rich Sauvignon Blanc.",90,24.0
2233,Montes,"The vintage was notoriously cold in Chile, and this wine reflects that. Green, herbaceous flavors of grass and alfalfa blend with citrusy notes, while the finish is pyrazinic and borderline bitter.",84,16.0
2234,Concha y Toro,"There are woody aromas to the nose but little fruit. This is fresh but empty in the mouth, with woody flavors of barbecue and hickory but, once again, minimal fruitiness.",84,11.0
2235,DFJ Vinhos,"On the lean, mineral side, this is a firm, extracted wine. It has a dry core that is masking the hints of juicy berry fruits. Give the wine a year to allow it to soften and drink from 2016.",85,9.0
2236,Wines & Winemakers,"The blend of Fernão Pires and Arinto gives a fruity, fresh and fragrant wine, with lively bright acidity. A lemon edge is filled out by ripe apricot flavor, resulting in a rounded finish. Drink from 2016.",85,11.0
2237,V. Sattui,"The odd but endearing Riesling trait of petrol stands out in the aroma of this light-bodied and dry wine, while the flavors are more like apple juice with a touch of honey and earthiness. The mouthfeel is smooth, and a little richness lingers on the finish.",85,25.0
2238,DFJ Vinhos,"Apples and crisp pears give this wine its intensely fresh character. It has bright acidity that shoots right through the wine, resulting in a tangy texture. Drink now.",85,9.0
2239,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"This is a concentrated, dark and brooding wine. Its complexity comes from the interplay of tannins and rich red fruits, laced with tight acidity. Serious and dense, it is a wine for long aging. Drink this impressive wine from 2019.",92,153.0
2240,Foxen,"Rustic aromas of blackberry, leather, pepper, dried violet and a light tar show on the nose of this appellation-blend bottling. Cocoa and dark elderberry appear on the sip, along with dried herb. It's a light style of Syrah, but vibrant and versatile.",90,44.0
2241,Georges Duboeuf,"Gérard Charvet took over Rosiers from his father in 1983 and remains focused on the art of vinification. A percentage (30%) of wood aging has give this ripe wine its dense texture. That contrasts with the generous black fruits that are still developing. This is a serious, dense wine that will age. Drink from 2018.",90,24.0
2242,Kendall-Jackson,"Powerful fruit flavors and a firm, high-octane feeling on the palate make this a big, imposing wine. It offers tasty, ripe boysenberry-jam flavors, moderate tannins and a lip-smacking finish.",89,17.0
2243,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"Ripe yellow fruits give this wine a soft and rich character. With a tangy, citrus edge it is also crisp and fresh. The combination makes for a lively, light wine that is ready to drink.",86,31.0
2244,Trapiche,"Three years ago Trapiche started making three high-end single-vineyard Malbecs; Aciar's seems a little more closed and flat than its cousins, but it does pump forward with rock-solid blackberry and cola flavors. It's better on the attack than the follow-through, but the flavors are excellent and the balance is proper even if the length is short.",90,47.0
2245,Albert Bichot,"This has a mineral character that shines through the crisp, fresh citrus and green plums. It is immediately attractive and is delicious to drink now.",89,25.0
2246,Louis Latour,"A flagship wine for this producer, this is rich and seductive, opulent even. Bold yellow fruits, ripe apples and pears are surrounded by a youthful texture that will allow it to age. The fruit and the touches of wood are still present, but will integrate beautfully. Drink this wine from 2023.",95,165.0
2247,Albert Bichot,"From one of the high-quality Premier Crus that have much of the reflected glory of the Vosne-Romanée grand crus, the beautiful wine is ripe and packed with great red fruits. Its wood aging is a rich support to this opulent wine with considerable potential. Drink from 2025.",95,195.0
2248,Foxen,"Extremely alluring aromas of black plum and blackberry meet with touches of caramel, vanilla and fresh rose on the nose of this bottling. Raspberry and cranberry pop on the sip, but it's the garrigue character of black sage and thyme, plus a bit of white pepper, that rounds out the seamlessly integrated palate.",95,52.0
2249,Louis Latour,"This is Burgundian opulence, with generous, rounded black-fruit and -berry flavors. Supporting this richness are the tannins that will allow the wine to age. From Louis Latour Domaine vineyards, it has a solid, dense structure that needs plenty of time. Drink from 2027.",95,399.0
2250,Louis Latour,"This wine from the Corton Grand Cru vineyard is packed with tannins as well as smoky fruit. It is richly structured and firm, yet the fruit is equally powerful, showing bold black fruits struck against bright acidity. The wine will need considerable aging; drink from 2025.",95,165.0
2251,Louis Latour,"This structured wine comes from one of the lesser-known Grand Crus of Vosne-Romanée. But it does have the structure and density of the wines from this run of grand crus, with bold tannins over the red-cherry fruits. It is likely to be a structured wine for many years. Drink from 2027.",95,650.0
2252,Siduri,"The nose on this bottling from the iconic vineyard co-owned by the Pisoni and Franscioni families is quite sultry, with lots of violet and purple-flower aromas as well as mulberry, black raspberry, forest floor and grilled meat. The earthy fruit flavors of mulberry are strong on the sip, playing well with the loamy soils, dusty minerality, stiffer tannins and persistent acidity. A deep and layered wine.",94,60.0
2253,Louis Latour,"This wine is firm yet ripe, with a bold yet tight character that foreshadows a rich wine in the future. The cherry and red plum flavors are lush and generous. It is going to be a delicious wine, full of concentration. Drink from 2023.",94,95.0
2254,Chanson Père et Fils,"This is a generous wine, although one that will need some serious aging. It is rich in tannins and powered by a firm structure. The fruit offers the weight to counter the tannins. It just needs time. Drink from 2024.",94,93.0
2255,Columbia Crest,"Merlot and Cabernet Franc make up the majority of this blend. Aromas of blue fruit, herb, pencil lead and barrel spice are followed by smooth plum flavors. Milk chocolate notes persist on the finish.",88,12.0
2256,Montes,"Blackberry and spice aromas are earthy, leathery and stalky. This is youthful and tannic at this point, while oaky flavors of clove and wood spice ride heavily atop blackberry and dark plum fruit. Oak notes and firm tannins indicate that this will be best from late 2015 through 2018.",90,22.0
2257,Maryhill,"This Proprietor's Reserve Grenache is one of a handful of Maryhill's 2010 reds that improves upon the previous vintage. Sappy and relatively substantial, this has a core of Bing cherry, along with chewy tannins and an earthy finish.",86,20.0
2258,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Bright and citrus-driven, this no-fuss wine would pair with grilled shrimp or freshwater fish. The wine is zesty and fresh overall.",86,16.0
2259,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"From vines grown below the Roche de Solutré cliff, this is a tight wine with a mineral texture and steely acidity. The structure will soften to give a wine that is full and concentrated, with plenty of acidity as well as citrus flavors. Wait until 2017.",87,23.0
2260,Louis Latour,"This fresh and fruity wine is made with without wood. Citrus crisp and with lively acidity, it refreshing, and perfumed. Drink now.",87,25.0
2261,Chehalem,"The fruit shines brightly in this all-stainless cuvée. Ripe golden apples are at the core, with hints of peach and papaya. It's a lovely, forward, ready-to-drink style that brings extra concentration and detail that is all too rare in unoaked Chardonnays.",91,19.0
2262,Santa Ema,"Dry, smoky and rubbery on the nose, with olive notes. The palate is a bit sharp, with plum, berry and herbal flavors. Finishes mildly leafy, with solid overall fruit and common Chilean herbal-green notes.",84,10.0
2263,Louis Latour,"Open and flattering, as are many of the 2000s, showing a dose of smoky, toasty oak layered over buttered nuts, honey and peach. Turns more citrusy on the finish, with tangerine and mineral notes lingering gently. Quite oaky, but has the depth of fruit to support it.",91,55.0
2264,Chehalem,"Although this is a rather light and tart wine, it has unusual flavors of cured ham and lots of herbal power in the finish, which is leafy and tannic. It might be better as a component in a blend, but as a stand-alone it shows some genuine terroir.",89,44.0
2265,Louis Latour,The appellation in the Côte Chalonnaise only produces white wine. This wine has a smooth and creamy character with attractive acidity and bright acidity. It is a perfumed wine just hinting at a more mineral texture. Drink from 2017.,88,40.0
2266,Casa Santos Lima,"This is a ripe wine that includes Chardonnay and Viognier in its blend. It has yellow fruits that are cut with plenty of acidity. A cool, crisp element reminds that the vineyards are close to the ocean. The wine is ready to drink.",86,10.0
2267,Gary Farrell,"Very little of this bottling was made. It's an experiment in making a white wine the way one would a red, fermented with skins and seeds, then aged eight months in new French oak. It's not for everyone. Cloudy and funky, it's teeming with acidity and yet somewhat dense on the palate, the fruit muted in favor of a taste of flowers and clay.",86,50.0
2268,Kunde,"This wine's tart, high-pitched acidity greets the palate with a youthful splash of lemon and lime before revealing its true concentration of rich toasted oak and baked apple flavor. Fulsome on the palate, it ends on a taste of the tropics.",88,45.0
2269,Albert Bichot,"For a wine meant to be consumed now, this is almost too tannic. It has bright fruit and a flavor of black currant skin, plus a dry, tannic core.",85,13.0
2270,Bründlmayer,"A full, yeasty wine, this has gentle acidity, with a touch of smokiness as well as a note of apple It feels full, without the necessary crispness.",85,44.0
2271,Georges Duboeuf,The Descombes family has farmed vines in this appellation since the French Revolution and Jean-Ernest Descombes supplied one of Georges Duboeuf's first Morgon wines in 1968. The latest generation has produced a ripe and fruity wine with a balanced structure. It is dense in tannins that will soften over the next year. Drink from 2018.,91,22.0
2272,Santa Ema,"Scratchy, spicy aromas and a touch of juniper accent red-berry scents on this everyday Cabernet. The mouthfeel is dry, fresh and shows tangy acidity, while racy, edgy flavors of plum, spice and green herbs finish zesty.",86,10.0
2273,Chanson Père et Fils,This wine is ripe with generous strawberry flavors and perfumed acidity. A smoky edge accompanies tastes of red cherry. The wine is rounded and light with attractive final acidity.,88,63.0
2274,Chehalem,"Medium bodied, this fruity vineyard-designate has a peppery spice note. A touch of dried herb and a hint of earth carry onto the finish.",89,48.0
2275,Concha y Toro,"This is heady for Chilean Chardonnay, with baked apple and no shortage of toast on the bouquet. It feels fresh but full, with polish and elegance to the mouthfeel. Flavors of apple and spiced squash end in a whirl of cinnamon and mild oak-related resin, while a final touch of acidity keeps things lively.",89,35.0
2276,Concha y Toro,"There's no denying this wine's greenness: It's draped all over the nose, palate and finish. But that doesn't mean it's not a classy, structured, tangy wine with length and clarity. It's a food wine for sure, with pickled, briny notes on the finish. Drink with ceviche, crudo and raw oysters.",89,17.0
2277,Albert Bichot,"In this generous, fruity wine, rich flavors are cut by grapefruit acidity and aromatic herbs. The texture is full in the mouth with good refreshing flavors as well a juicy, aftertaste.",85,12.0
2278,Montes,"Loamy, dark, rich aromas of pastry, blackberry, blueberry and turned earth scream “ripe.” In the mouth, this is bulky but focused. Flavors of black fruits, chocolate, fig, herbs and spice finish with notes of tobacco, raw oak, mint and bright acidity. Drink now through 2019.",92,90.0
2279,Casa Santos Lima,"Full of tannins at this stage, it shows power and density. It's a blend of more than 10 varieties, giving complexity as well as structure. There is acidity as well, bringing together the rich texture and a solid, wood and dark fruit combination. It needs to age a few years, so drink from 2016.",92,26.0
2280,Concha y Toro,"Deep, alluring aromas of blackberry and cassis are youthful and thus a bit animal and wild. In the mouth, this young CS is chunky, rubbery and dense. Flavors of blackberry, cassis and black coffee are on the dark side, while the finish offers a meaty, substantive feel, tons of lasting fruit flavor, and a touch of heat and burn that will fade away with more time in bottle. Best from 2016–2022.",92,50.0
2281,Concha y Toro,"Red and dense in color, with plum and raspberry aromas supported by a strong scent of barrel char, this is a generous, plump Pinot showing a mix of plum, berry and herbal flavors. A long-lasting, oaky finish concludes this oak-rich, fuller-bodied offering.",89,25.0
2282,Columbia Crest,Mandarin orange and orange-blossom aromas leap up from the glass. It drinks sweet with abundant orange flavors that linger.,89,12.0
2283,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"From Aegerter's own vineyards, this is an initially soft wine. It's only when the background tannins kick in that it becomes firmer, giving a dry, still-young core to this ripe wine. Red fruits dominate, balanced by acidity and a stylish, while firm, aftertaste. Drink from 2017.",89,82.0
2284,Wines & Winemakers,"This is a powerful wine, perfumed and ripe. Its aromas come from the Touriga Nacional in the blend that also includes Syrah and Alicante Bouschet. It's a dark and dense wine, very rich with enough juicy black fruit to balance. The concentration and tannins suggest long aging, so don't drink before 2019.",92,18.0
2285,Siduri,"Aromas of rose petals and fresh-hoed earth come to the fore as this wine opens, followed by fine-grained, intense tannins and savory wooded notes. Black pepper, red cherry, sea salt and dried herb pop at different times. It's still tight, so let this wine open in the glass or decant; better yet, cellar through 2023.",92,54.0
2286,Santa Ema,"Like any good Leyda Valley SB, this opens with oceanic aromas of citrus fruits, sea foam and minerality. In the mouth, it is juicy and stony, with washing acidity. Flavors of honeydew, lime and jalapeño finish firm, with good backbone. Drink this with salads, shellfish and ceviche.",88,15.0
2287,Gary Farrell,"Dark yellow in color, this wine shows tangy green apple and a richer, more concentrated element of apple-spice cake, with supportive, balanced acidity. With a bright, lifted finish, this less-expensive offering compared with many of the producer's single-vineyard designates never lets up on complexity or deliciousness.",95,35.0
2288,Foxen,"Intriguing lemongrass, Asian pear, chamomile, jasmine and pink grapefruit aromas arise on the nose of this dynamic single-block bottling. Tons of energy show on the sip, which is light and yet offers lots of intriguing flavors, from white sesame and chalk to lime peels and grippy yellow grapefruit pithiness.",94,35.0
2289,Feudi di San Gregorio,"One of the most important expressions of Merlot from southern Italy, Pàtrimo is a soft and decadent wine, boasting an excellent quality of ripe fruit that's backed by pretty tones of crushed stone, lead pencil and Indian spice. The mouthfeel is rich, generous and long lasting.",93,105.0
2290,Kendall-Jackson,"A fine everyday Pinot Noir with some extra features that boost the score. With hints of mint, white pepper and chamomile tea, the wine shows racy flavors of cherries, cola, raspberries and sandalwood. Made mainly with Monterey and Santa Barbara fruit.",87,18.0
2291,Testarossa,"Vigorous and tannic, this young Pinot is hard right now. It also seems a little unbalanced, with some raisins and mint bracketing the cherries. Could just be going through an awkward youth. Try in 2011.",87,54.0
2292,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Ste. Michelle's Dry Riesling carries a special, gold-colored label, and the word ‘dry' is prominently displayed. Dry it is, tart and bracing, but not so sour as to demand only oysters as an accompaniment. This is an all-purpose Riesling, great with spicy noodle dishes and other palate-burners.",87,12.0
2293,Georges Duboeuf,"This is a romantic conjunction of names. The cru wine is silky and smooth, with integrated tannins and red-cherry fruit. It is bright and crisply textured, ready to drink from mid-2017.",88,22.0
2294,Georges Duboeuf,"This cru wine comes from a 44-acre vineyard with 50-year-old vines supplied by one of Duboeuf's regular growers. It is structured and dense, perhaps too dense with its heavy dry tannins. The wine will need time. Drink from 2019.",88,20.0
2295,Georges Duboeuf,"Full of crisp fruit, this cru wine is bright with red-berry flavors. It is light and with a cool character that comes from the high altitude of the vineyards. There is an edgy texture that keeps the wine together. Drink now.",88,20.0
2296,Georges Duboeuf,"A floral wine, full of ripe black-cherry fruit and with a firm structure that sustains the wine. This cru wine is rich, still developing, still with enough tannins and acidity to allow it to age further. Drink this attractive wine from mid-2017.",88,20.0
2297,Albert Bichot,"This warm, ripe Chablis has a hint of tangy texture along with intense white-fruit acidity. It is a delicious wine, still young, and will be better from 2018.",88,23.0
2298,Albert Bichot,"This delightfully fruity wine also has a great tang of acidity and minerality. It shows a crisp character, with a bite of apple peel and a lively mousse at the end. Drink now.",88,27.0
2299,Chanson Père et Fils,"Smooth textured, this wine is packed with ripe fruits that are touched with spice. Rounded and laden with apricot and mango flavors, it's ready to drink.",88,17.0
2300,V. Sattui,"Made from 75% Chardonnay and 25% Pinot Noir, with detectable residual sugar, this wine is moderately complex in its mix of peach, cherry and citrus flavor. The acidity is simple and direct. The palate is thick and creamy.",88,35.0
2301,Gary Farrell,"With the goal of adding subtle aromatics and structure, this wine was given eight months in 50% new French oak puncheons, with the other 50% in neutral. The wine intrigues as much as refreshes, with crisp acidity and bright sparks of citrus prominent. Medium bodied, it has a complexity of baked apple and pear lurking in the background.",92,60.0
2302,Wines & Winemakers,"A powerful wine that has licorice and black coffee flavors as well as ripe plum and berry fruits. The balance is there, along with a solid structural base and acidity. The dense wine has power, rich and ripe for development. Drink from 2018.",92,40.0
2303,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"The cool, crisp nature of Pernand is well expressed in this tight, mineral and tangy wine. It has fine acidity along with fresh apple and citrus fruits. The good texture will allow the wine to age. Drink from 2018.",92,52.0
2304,DFJ Vinhos,"The full juiciness of Castelão is balanced by spice and structure from wood maturation. The result is a smooth, textured wine, firm with tannins for aging. It is rich, smoky, dry and edgy at this young stage. Drink from 2016.",90,15.0
2305,DFJ Vinhos,"This is a firmly structured, dark wine. It has black cherry and berry fruit, a solid core of tannins and tight acidity. With its dense character, there is every chance of this impressive wine aging well, yielding a more rounded wine. Drink from 2016.",90,9.0
2306,Wines & Winemakers,"Full-bodied and ripe, this is a rich, generous wine that shows complexity as well as subtle fruitiness. A blend of Viosinho and Verdelho, it's full of tropical fruit flavors, with ample weight and concentration. Spicy accents, a dense texture and a fine, long-lasting finish are all part of this stylish wine.",90,18.0
2307,Robert Mondavi,"It's easy to use the word “huge” to describe this Cabernet, which contains smaller amounts of Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc. It immediately takes over the palate with ripe, opulent cherry pie, blackberry tart, cassis liqueur, green olive and oak flavors. The tannins are very strong, the most powerful of Mondavi Cabernets in years. Which leads to the question of ageability. Where's this wine going? On the negative side is high alcohol, which gives it a burn. So drink it over the next 5–6 years.",90,135.0
2308,Maryhill,"As a 100% varietal wine, blue fruit, vanilla and herb aromas are followed by abundant cherry flavors, with lightly dry tannins backing them up. The oak plays a prominent role.",87,43.0
2309,Trapiche,"Tropical fruit and citrus aromas turn toward air freshener and bath soap upon airing. This feels standard for Torrontés, maybe even a bit flabby, with lychee and melon flavors that finish chalky.",85,15.0
2310,Kunde,"A very nice Cab, a little dry and brittle by itself, but with a rich core of black currants, cherries and herbs framed in rich tannins. All it needs is a good steak to make it sing.",87,22.0
2311,Gary Farrell,"Almond and anise open what evolves into a concentrated expression of a stellar vineyard site in a great vintage in good winemaking hands. Honey and baked peach initially fool the palate into anticipating that this wine might head into full-blown hedonism, but subtle layers of lemon, grapefruit and pear keep it crisp, fresh and ultimately complex. Creamy, it retains plenty of acidity for balance.",94,45.0
2312,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"This is a warm and rich wine from the southern Mâcon region. It is ripe with yellow fruits, crisp apples and a touch of minerality that gives the tangy texture. Packed with fruit as well as structured, this wine can be drunk now, although better from 2017.",88,34.0
2313,Montes,"Warm, rubbery berry aromas mixed with smoked meat and herbal accents make for a solid nose, and while the palate has clampy acidity and herbal notes, there's ample body, roundness and berry fruit to bring it home. Both leafy and candied on the finish.",87,24.0
2314,Montes,"Clean and ripe, with apple, pear and zesty citrus aromas. The palate runs more round and candied than linear and sharp, with sweet, welcoming flavors of white peach and dried citrus fruits. Fuller-bodied and inviting, but still fresh. Drink immediately.",87,12.0
2315,Undurraga,"Thick and meaty on the nose, with aromas of cola and spice. The palate has a tight structure, some sharpness and spicy, braised-fruit and tobacco flavors. Finishes mostly in the spice zone, with dried fruits and a spot of leftover acidic bite. Good for a basic Cabernet-Carmenère blend.",87,13.0
2316,DFJ Vinhos,"This structured, dense and smoky wine features dry tannins and a mineral texture. It has blackberry fruitiness to go with this scaffolding, so it will develop well to give a ripe, full, rich wine. Wait until 2015.",88,10.0
2317,Wines & Winemakers,"An intense wine. it has a cool feel from its 900-foot-high vineyards. Plenty of acidity keeps it fresh and fruity, bringing out flavors of black currant as well as spicy wood. It could age a year, so wait until 2015.",87,11.0
2318,Wines & Winemakers,"This is an attractive, fruity, fresh rosé. It is dry but balances acidity and fruitiness with its sweet strawberry fruit and light touch of vanilla pod. Drink now.",87,12.0
2319,V. Sattui,"Simple in buttered popcorn and toast flavors, this Chard has underlying flavors of pineapples. It's a dry wine, crisp in acidity. Made in the popular style for drinking now.",86,22.0
2320,Testarossa,"Straightforward Pinot Noir scents of red fruit, deep raspberry, fennel and menthol make for an uncomplicated but alluring nose on this wine from an historic vineyard. The  palate ranges widely, soft and expressive with pomegranate, tart raspberry and a touch of clove.",88,61.0
2321,Williams Selyem,"From the great site in Occidental, this white shines in pear, peach and pineapple flavors, while an inviting floral aroma of honeysuckle permeates the nose. Integrated oak and a creamy palate make for a fulsome, voluptuous experience, balanced and complemented by the wine's crushed-gravel minerality.",94,65.0
2322,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"This succulent effort proves once again that a hot site can make excellent Riesling in Washington state. The Cold Creek signature minerality provides the base, and the fruit, vibrant and fresh, brings juicy acidity as well. The wine sails into a creamy finish that demands a glass refill.",90,15.0
2323,Columbia Crest,"Columbia Crest makes a limited number of single vineyard reserves. This Zinfandel comes from what is emerging as the best site for that grape in Washington. Bright, tart, and full of sappy raspberry and red fruits, this young, ageworthy Zin has great penetration and punch. In style, it is closest to classic Dry Creek Zins from such producers as A. Rafanelli and Doug Nalle. Though labeled simply Columbia Valley, it's actually the Wahluke Slope AVA.",90,35.0
2324,Albert Bichot,"The tannins here are fine, dusty almost, giving the wine a softer core than is normal for this vineyard. Around the tannins, the jammy blackberry fruits give a sweet side to the flavors. Rich and soft.",90,
2325,DFJ Vinhos,"Rich and bold, it's a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Tinta Roriz, both giving a floral character as well as some concentrated tannins. The dry structure and the intense acidity at the end suggest some aging. Drink from 2015.",88,9.0
2326,Chehalem,"The see-through strawberry color announces the lightness of the vintage. But it smells attractive and pleasant, with cedar and briar. In the mouth, it runs along a tart, lean line, again a reflection on the year. There's some Burgundian elegance, but only minimal depth of fruit. Overall a pretty wine best for drinking with food.",87,38.0
2327,Williams Selyem,This has some simple flavors of sour cherry candy and oak. The structure is overly soft and lacking tension. Drink up.,85,37.0
2328,Columbia Crest,"The Grand Estates Merlot has to be considered one of the best—if not the best—budget Merlots in the world. The color is pure and deep, there is a strong tannic spine, and the flavors of cassis and coffee, boysenberry and chocolate could be coming from a much more expensive bottle.",89,11.0
2329,Iron Horse,"This wine become pretty pricey but that's because consumers recognize its quality; its sheer deliciousness can't be beat. It has all the elements of fine Russian River Pinot—it's dry and has lots o f ripe fruit, pretty oak, toast and spice—and it puts them all together in a super-elegant package. The vintage is light but the wine doesn't seem to mind. Its class shows. `",90,50.0
2330,Concha y Toro,"Bacon and lavender are prominent on the meaty, slightly muddled nose, which unfolds gracefully if given lots and lots of time. Blackberry and some tannins up front, a fairly nice and buttery middle, and finally cola accents on the grapy, heavy, long finish. For years this was C&T;'s top effort, before Almaviva.",88,40.0
2331,Concha y Toro,"Partial barrel-fermentation shows in this wine's hints of vanilla and cream, which marry smoothly with grapefruit and melon fruit. The grapefruit shades toward pink, particularly on the pleasantly crisp finish.",88,29.0

2333,Wines & Winemakers,"Named after the Tyto Alba, the barn owl that lives in the forests around the vineyard, the wine shows a tropical fruit side of Sauvignon Blanc. Mango and pineapple dominate the ripe character of the wine. It is aromatic, just hinting at something more herbal. Drink from 2017.",88,23.0
2334,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"At the south end of Chassagne-Montrachet, Morgeots Premier Cru is close to abbey ruins. This young, toasty wine is ripe, smooth and creamy. Rich apple and green plum flavors are balanced by acidity and touched by honey. The wood aging is still prominent and needs to tone down, so drink from 2018.",91,112.0
2335,Maryhill,"A simple red, with sharp acids that give an edgy cut to the mouthfeel. This would be a fine pizza wine, or good with grilled sausages.",84,17.0
2336,Maryhill,"This is a typical, standard style of Syrah, that tastes strongly of vanilla rather than of the actual grape. The fruit is muted, but the vanilla and tobacco flavors stand out.",84,17.0
2337,Louis Jadot,"From one of the rare south-facing vineyards in Beaune, this warm, rich and ripe wine is generous with its spice, smokiness and rounded red fruits. Acidity cuts through, bringing raspberry in its wake. The sense of structure really gives this wine its power and density. Drink from 2020.",94,62.0
2338,Foxen,"Cinnamon spice and pomegranate fruit give a soft touch to minerally driven aromas of black slate and wet cement on the nose of this block-designated (and trademarked!) wine. The wine's tannic grip and tartness are apparent on the texturally distinct palate before raspberry, hibiscus and rose petal flavors settle into a long, rich finish.",94,62.0
2339,Foxen,"From another vintage of Billy Wathen home runs comes this bottling from friend Rick Longoria's vineyard. It shows bramble berries, elderberries, sagebrush juniper and roasting herbs on the nose. Layers of thyme and dried oregano decorate the raspberry juice and pencil-lead palate.",94,66.0
2340,Louis Jadot,"Wonderful spice and ripe red fruits shoot through this rich while structured wine. Dark cherries, strawberries and a ripe texture have given a wine that will be beautiful, smooth and generous. The acidity and the core of tannins will allow it to age well. Drink from 2019.",94,62.0
2341,Louis Jadot,"A generous wine, this features intense dark fruits, ripe strawberry and an almost -weet character. It's packed with spice, richness and beautiful concentration. Great acidity gives a wine that is developing freshness and weight. Drink from 2020.",94,62.0
2342,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"Tender notes of citrus appear at first through a veil of yeast. Their zestiness then fills out with subtle, earthy spice. On the light, dry palate, the true subtlety hits: wafts of lemon, aromatic wild thyme, Seville orange zest, fresh apple peel and wet stone. The delicacy of the concentrated body is astonishing, with a central vein of lemony freshness that provides a focal point. So subtle, so layered and alive: with every new sip new nuances occur.",94,80.0
2343,Santa Ema,"Spicy, toasty, blackened aromas of cassis and blackberry feed into a fresh, agile, free-moving palate. This Bordeaux-modeled blend tastes of herbal cherry, plum and pepper, while the finish is zesty and blackened in flavor, with crisp acidity creating length. Drink through 2022.",90,85.0
2344,Testarossa,"Mulberry, wet rock and sagebrush show on the nose of this single vineyard bottling from a site owned by the Hahn family. The palate is tangy at first, revealing dark red fruit with a smoky kick as it opens, backed by hints of juniper and dust.",91,67.0
2345,Fess Parker,"Boysenberry, black plum, condensed rose petal and cola touches show on the nose of this clonal selection, which offers very purple-seeming aromas.

2347,Louis Jadot,"Coming mainly from the villages of Ladoix and Chorey-lès-Beaune, this wine is a delicious example of the juicy, ripe fruit that comes from the Côte de Beaune. It's soft and open, with a generous character that makes it ready to drink soon, from 2018.",89,38.0
2348,Montes,"Montes tosses quite a few qualifiers at the name of this wine; i.e. “special cuvée” and “reserve,” but at the end of the day it's a basic Merlot with earthy notes and some obvious oak. The fruit flavors veer toward plum and blackberry, while below that there's a shot of woodiness.",84,10.0

2351,Wines & Winemakers,"Using grapes sourced from old vines, this is dark and concentrated. It's dominated at the start by firm, dry tannins, with its power coming from its dark, brooding fruit and dense structure. Age for at least four years.",91,15.0
2352,Trapiche,"A high-end Malbec experience at a reasonable price, this boasts rich aromas of cola, graphite and boysenberry that leap from the glass. The palate is bright and just thick enough, with wild berry, cherry, plum and oak-based flavors. Another whack of oak, along with vanilla, chocolate and tobacco flavors, graces the finish. Drink now–2015.",91,25.0

2356,Georges Duboeuf,"This wine has red-currant fruits, along with acidity and light tannins. The wine is crisp and fruity, maybe not expressing the full power of a Morgon but can be enjoyed now for its fruitiness.",85,20.0
2357,Georges Duboeuf,"This strawberry and caramel-flavored wine has bright acidity and a crisp, clean aftertaste. The fruit right up front gives a refreshing summer-afternoon feel. Drink now.",85,
2358,Kendall-Jackson,"Root beer and slate show on the very restrained nose of this wine that combines fruit from Monterey County (66%) and Santa Barbara Counry (34%). The palate is light and slightly metallic, with iron as well as eucalyptus and shreds of cranberry and raspberry fruit.",85,26.0
2359,Williams Selyem,"Somewhat aloof now, this has grippy tannins that lock down the palate. Underneath the grip are complex flavors of juicy blackberry, plum sauce and exotic spice, with brooding earthy notes and sweet, smoky oak tones. Very fine, but one for the cellar. Give it at least 6–8 years, and it could easily go for another decade beyond that, gradually becoming more delicate, supple and complex.",94,82.0
2360,Williams Selyem,"Rich tannins give this wine a bracing mouthfeel, but it's still drinkable now. While it's a big wine, the palate feels -elegant and silky, with spicy flavors of black cherry and licorice. The 2010s should have one of the longer shelf lives of recent vintages, holding for at least another decade.",94,65.0
2361,Bründlmayer,"This wine is full and opulent, and its yellow fruit is at the fore. The ripeness is tempered by the complex notes of spice and almond as well as the taut, steely acidity. Age for at least four years.",94,
2362,Williams Selyem,"Made using classic Port grape varieties, this is rich and sweet, with chocolate, coffee, orange, plum and spice flavors. Crisp acidity provides needed balance. It shows a complexity that lifts it above the ordinary. Drink now–2015.",93,40.0
2363,Bründlmayer,"Full and rich, this is a beautifully concentrated wine. It's packed with apricot and citrus, but it also has a serious, mineral -driven side that gives it a taut texture. The acidity is intense, and it needs several months to soften and integrate. Keep this for 2–3 years or more.",93,
2364,DFJ Vinhos,"A highly perfumed, lime-dominated wine that gets some freshness from apple skins and high acidity. Its flavors do feel awkward, fresh from the candy shop rather than the vineyard.",82,8.0
2365,DFJ Vinhos,"Typical of the wines from Estremadura, low in alcohol, offering great juicy fruit, very fresh, bursting with red currants and berries. It is balanced, a vivid painting of bright flavors.",85,8.0
2366,Georges Duboeuf,"This nine-acre property has produced a fruity wine that has only the lightest tannins. It is much more to do with red cherries, red currants and crisp acidity. The wine is ready to drink.",86,20.0
2367,Concha y Toro,"Grapy but generic black-fruit aromas open this wide bulky Malbec that's high in acidity. Salty grapy flavors are plump but simple, while this finishes with a toasted element and blocky weight.",86,17.0
2368,Casa Santos Lima,"This wine has a lively, open and fruity side that promises plenty of good barbecues. Red fruits and acidity lie easily together. Drink now.",86,10.0
2369,DFJ Vinhos,"This is a ripe wine with soft tannins and juicy black fruits. It has a good balance between the fruit and the structure, making it a wine for early, easy, beside-the-barbecue drinking.",86,10.0
2370,Foxen,"Light in color and light-bodied in the mouth, this Grenache-based Rhône blend offers easy, sweet flavors of cherries, cola, vanilla and oak.",85,35.0
2371,Columbia Crest,"Appealing aromas of grass, herbs and tropical fruit lead to tart, sleekly styled fruit flavors that show a touch of bitterness on the finish.",86,15.0
2372,Albert Bichot,"A bold, rich wine with yellow fruits, toast and spice. At the same time, there is a crisp, tight edge of acidity and minerality that gives a sense of the cool character of the chalk soil of Chablis. A fine wine, lively, ripe, but totally fresh.",92,
2373,Albert Bichot,"A wine that offers many personalities, from serious complexity to broad, smiling, ripe fruits. Pineapple, peaches, almonds and acidity come together in a texture that is still integrating. Give the wine another two years at least.",92,
2374,Albert Bichot,"A warm, toasty wine, maybe with too much wood at the moment, but with proper plump, ripe peach flavors and an edge of apple-skin acidity. The wine needs aging —give it 4–5 years.",92,
2375,Kendall-Jackson,"Powerful fruit flavors and a firm, high-octane feeling on the palate make this a big, imposing wine. It offers tasty, ripe boysenberry-jam flavors, moderate tannins and a lip-smacking finish.",89,17.0
2376,Albert Bichot,"A blend of wine that has been aged in tank and in wood, this is structured although with a great layer of juicy red fruits. The combination preserves the natural fruitiness of the wine while giving it the tannins to age. Drink from late 2017.",89,30.0
2377,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"The 20th anniversary of this bottling, this wine is principally Cabernet Sauvignon (70%) and Merlot (26%) with the fruit coming largely from Canoe Ridge and Cold Creek vineyards. Alluring café au lait, toast, dark chocolate and cherry aromas are followed by black and blue fruit flavors that linger on the finish.",91,65.0
2378,Gary Farrell,"From the Laguna Ridge neighborhood of the larger appellation, this is a subtle, fuller-bodied wine that's silky and refined in dark cherry, anise and rich earth. Pomegranate and cassis play in the background, the flavors nuanced and complex, with a tangy, citrus-tinged finish.",91,60.0
2379,Louis Latour,"This wine is soft and round, with attractive acidity as well as a light sense of structure from tannins. It features considerable acidity along with wild strawberry flavors that keep it lifted and aromatic. Drink from 2017.",91,90.0
2380,Williams Selyem,"Intensely ripe, jammy raspberry and cherry fruit marks this impressive young Pinot Noir. It shows Williams Selyem's impeccable balance and elegance, but is a little soft and direct, lacking nuance. Could do interesting things in the bottle down the years, but seems best now and through 2014.",91,75.0
2381,Concha y Toro,"Passion fruit, tangerine and fresh asparagus aromas are typical of this wine, which has been setting the pace for Chilean Sauvignon Blanc since its inception several years ago. The palate is snappy and busting loose with just-ripe banana and melon, while the finish is textured and long.",89,20.0
2382,Montes,"This could very well be Chile's most expressive, interesting white Sauvignon. It's got all those prickly pineapple, passion fruit, scallion and pepper notes that are typical, and also a lot of pure citrus flavors backing it all up. The mouthfeel is zesty and spirited, but there's natural roundness, too. Some licorice adds complexity to the finish. Best Buy.",89,10.0
2383,Testarossa,"Lighter in body and substance than the 2000 vintage, with cola, cherry and spice flavors wrapped in soft, easy tannins and crisp acids. Drinks very dry, with oaky influences. Nice in the mouth, and versatile at the table, but basically simple.",89,50.0
2384,Montes,"Dusty oily aromas of citrus peel, almond and yeasty white fruits come with a hint of oak. This Chardonnay feels solid and balanced, but regular. A mix of oak spice, vanilla and briny peach flavors do a slow soft fade on the finish.",86,13.0
2385,Kunde,"From head-trained vines interspersed with Alicante Bouschet and Petite Sirah, this is a bright, likable wine, teased in bacon, cola and brown sugar that finds a fresh streak of red currant and juicy strawberry as it opens, the acidity in full view. A bite of chocolate dots the finish.",88,50.0
2386,Montes,"This electric-pink rosé of Syrah opens with aromas of yeast, chewing gum and pie cherry. The palate is on the full side, but it's not flabby or awkward. Citric flavors are more generic than specific, while this finishes with a burst of preserving acidity and then a lasting note of spent yeast.",88,16.0
2387,Testarossa,"Heavy and seemingly sweet, this has the taste of black raspberry syrup and melted red licorice.",85,18.0
2388,Santa Ema,"Opens with a mix of minerality, citrus and powdery white fruit scents. The palate packs tang and zest, while the flavors of green apple and lemon are lean, crisp and citric through the finish. Fresh but a little sharp and monotone.",86,10.0
2389,Columbia Crest,"A fuller, richer, more broadly fruity version of the winery's Two Vines offering, this crowd-pleasing Chardonnay slathers the palate with buttery brioche, apple and Asian pear. A little more acidity would help; give it a chill to compensate.",86,11.0
2390,Undurraga,"Like most Leyda Sauv Blancs, this pops with cool-climate aromas of bell pepper and grapefruit. It's narrow on the palate, with razor-sharp acidity and green tannins. Bell pepper and briny citrus flavors finish sharp, with a touch of sourness.",87,20.0
2391,Siduri,"This stubbornly tight, short, tart wine shows lightly spiced cherry fruit. But after being opened for some hours, the flavors seem to thin out quickly, leaving an impression of a wine that lacks concentration.",87,42.0
2392,V. Sattui,"The smell of roses is vivid and pure, and the flavor of nectarines is strong in this attention-grabbing, full-bodied and lavishly textured wine. Just as remarkable as the floral character, the rich texture clings to the mouth after each sip.",92,26.0
2393,Bründlmayer,"Sonorous nutty notes meld with herbal spice. Tangy grapefruit zest swings into there somewhere, as does a much clearer note of green Conference pear. This is closed but smooth and will open up like a flower bud. On the palate, there is a wonderfully pliant, lemon-accented texture of real freshness.",92,49.0
2394,DFJ Vinhos,"This fruity wine has bright acidity and a perfumed character. With its crisp texture, it is full of lemon and green apple fruit. Drink now.",84,9.0
2395,Williams Selyem,"Ferrington is one of Anderson Valley's best vineyards, and Williams Selyem has done an exceptional job with this impressive young '09. It's bone dry and fairly tannic, and the cherry and raspberry fruit flavors are balanced with earthy notes of cola, grilled mushrooms and dusty Indian spices. But it needs time. Better after 2015.",94,62.0
2396,Montes,"Hot pink in color, the palate is open and mild, but unstructured. Simple raspberry and plum flavors finish alert but with a basic finish of red and citrus fruits.",85,16.0
2397,Wines & Winemakers,"A soft, fruity wine, it comes straight from tank without any wood aging. It's a fine barbecue wine with its black currant fruitiness and light, dry tannins. Drink 2014.",84,11.0
2398,Undurraga,"Narrow, feline aromas and gritty citrus scents define the nose on this lean wine. Orange, lime and lettuce flavors finish mild, with angularity and a lasting twang.",84,10.0
2399,Wines & Winemakers,This is a big wine with dark tannins and rich black fruits that are powerful and dense. The strong mineral texture comes from the rocky soils of Catapereiro. Wood aging adds to the complexity. Drink from 2017.,89,12.0
2400,Kunde,"This blends 55% Cabernet Sauvignon and 45% Syrah from estate-farmed vineyards, the result a mix of cured meat, charred oak and rich, dark cherry. Full bodied and concentrated, it offers structure amid the ripeness.",86,28.0
2401,Siduri,"Not showing many complexities now. It's a big, ripe, fruity wine, with strong flavors of cherries, raspberries and smoky sandalwood, wrapped into a silky texture. Drink now.",85,33.0
2402,Concha y Toro,"Leathery, spicy, herbal berry aromas are a bit feral but remain typical of this variety. Jammy, fleshy and fruity on the palate, this exudes herbal plum and raspberry flavors with toasty, green notes. A minty, chunky, solid finish brings herbal notes that are indicative of the grape.",90,25.0
2403,Iron Horse,"Intensely colored, this wine is from a replanted estate block just coming into its own. The texture is soft and silky, yet austere. It dances in earthy blueberry and spicy cedar notes, finishing in a powerful pronouncement of oak.",90,85.0
2404,Kendall-Jackson,"An expressive version of the variety, this includes tiny percentages of Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon. Leathery plum and blueberry are the standouts in terms of aromas and flavors, with a soft, spicy streak that lifts the experience, finishing in a dusting of cocoa powder.",90,24.0
2405,Concha y Toro,"This hard-drilling, bullish Malbec is bright purple in color, with grapy, heady aromas. The palate is rubbery and grabby, with a shock of zesty acidity. Oversized, roasted black-fruit flavors finish with size, power and a grating feel.",86,18.0
2406,DFJ Vinhos,"In a reference to the storks who build nests in the chimneys of the Eiffel-designed DFJ winery, Storks Landing shows bright acidity, layers of citrus plus a touch of more exotic pineapple. A blend of Fernão Pires and Chardonnay, it's fresh and light in the mouth, mineral and crisp at the end.",86,8.0
2407,Casa Santos Lima,"Firm tannins give a dry character. Black fruits are laced with acidity to give the fruity element, while the dry core is dense and promising aging. Drink from 2016.",86,
2408,Wines & Winemakers,"This blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Fernão Pires is aromatic and ripe. Its fruitiness is tropical, with pineapple as well as apricot flavors. It's softly textured  and ready to drink.",86,15.0
2409,Undurraga,"Fleshy, tropical aromas with a touch of varietal snap set up a green palate with sweet lime and scallion flavors. The finish shows ripeness and tropical notes before turning heavy. Drink this well chilled.",85,11.0
2410,Kendall-Jackson,"Despite the broad appellation, South Coast fruit seems to dominate in the tropical fruit aromas, accompanied by a generous dose of spicy, vanilla-tinged oak. Similarly tastes very ripe and fruity, although has noticeable sweetness.",85,12.0
2411,Columbia Crest,"The blend here is two-thirds Merlot, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon and 12% Cabernet Franc. Tight and toasty, it carries a hint of green tannins that show up in an astringent, lightly chalky finish. The fruit is sharp and herbal, with a suggestion of heat.",89,35.0
2412,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Aromas of hazelnut nut, smoke and dried chamomile flower slowly come together. On the racy palate, a mineral vein underscores yellow apple, lime and dried sage while a bitter almond note wraps up the finish.",89,60.0
2413,Trapiche,"This is a direct, almost raw type of Cabernet. The nose deals spice, herb and dry-fruit aromas. The palate feels lively and alert, with firm acidity driving flavors of berry fruits, oak, herbs and spice. The finish is long, committed and spicy in nature, with a fair amount of oak.",89,21.0
2414,Wines & Winemakers,"An old-vines white wine from the Douro is rare, and this rich wine rewards the winemaker who found the grapes. Aged in wood, ripe and with lemon, peach and grapefruit flavors, it balances richness with a crisp, taut texture. Age this wine a year.",89,14.0
2415,V. Sattui,"This Zin, which contains a bit of Petite Sirah, isn't quite as concentrated as the winery's single-vineyard Zins. But it's close, and the price isn't as high. It's a powerful wine, full-bodied and rich in blackberries, currants, mocha, licorice and prunes, with a long, spicy finish.",89,32.0
2416,Kendall-Jackson,"A big, bold wine that also tastes precise and structured, it has deep, dense fruit flavors like black currant and black cherry, layers of fine tannins, hints of dark chocolate and espresso. This is a great wine to stash in the cellar, as it will taste best after 2020.",91,17.0
2417,Undurraga,"This is what you want from Chile. The bouquet of green apple, lime, mineral, sea air and controlled sweetness is impressive while not being forceful. Flavors of citrus, pineapple and green herbs are live-wire, while the feel is stimulating and spritzy. With a juicy finish and tons of zest,this is a lovely, true wine that reflects its coastal San Antonio origins.",90,22.0
2418,Georges Duboeuf,"This wine has structure and some dense tannins. Even though there is plenty of black and red cherry fruit, the wine's dry core and tight, mineral texture are still developing. Drink from 2017.",90,
2419,Columbia Crest,"This is a waxy, rather soft rendition of Sauvignon Blanc, and the pretty fruit flavors mix grapefruit, citrus and pineapple. There is very little suggestion of Sauvignon Blanc's herbal or grassy side; the grapes seem to have been ripened past that point, though not all the way to California-style, tropical fruit flavors. All in all this is a well-crafted, smooth and flavorful wine, with a portion barrel-aged for extra complexity.",87,11.0
2420,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"Clos Windsbuhl in Hunawihr is the northernmost of Zind-Humbrecht's collection of vineyards. In 2012, it has produced an impressive wine that has all the right spice of Pinot Gris along with acidity and a fresh edge. That gives this rich wine a great lift, with a waft of pear to go with the yellow-fruit flavors. Drink from 2016.",92,80.0
2421,Kendall-Jackson,"This is a tasty and accessibly priced Chardonnay. It packs in lots of fruit flavor, vibrant acidity, rich texture and layers of oaky spice while showing a rare sense of seamlessness. Very Californian and compelling.",91,17.0
2422,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"The Zind-Humbrecht Pinot Gris style brings out the richness of the variety. This wine is all spice, and intense flavors of pepper and lychee. The acidity creeps in making an impact on the initial mouthfeel. Very rich, concentrated.",92,44.0
2423,Fess Parker,"Your immediate impression of this Syrah is power. It's a darkly colored, big, thick and intensely flavored wine, with furry tannins framing massive flavors of blackberries, teryaki beef, black pepper and smoky oak. Easily deserves its high score despite a certain rude assault.",92,45.0
2424,Gary Farrell,"From a vineyard within the Santa Rosa Plains, this wine opens in pretty, floral aromas of violet and gentle rose. Seductive, it follows with bursts of blood orange and wild strawberry that remain faint and delicate on the palate, light and clear in color, and elegant in intensity. Still, there's enough backbone to the wine to keep it fresh and alive through the long finish.",94,55.0
2425,V. Sattui,"Preponderant green, herbal aroma and flavor marks this wine. The mix of pencil lead and a smoky char never really make friends.",83,65.0
2426,Santa Ema,"This wine has an overtly oaky nose. Following suit, the palate is resiny and sticky in feel, with little fruit flavor but a whole lot of cheap-tasting wood character.",82,15.0
2427,Gary Farrell,"This gorgeous Zinfandel comes from a vineyard on Bradford Mountain at 1,000 feet elevation, with the vines planted in red, volcanic soils. The palate explodes in juicy plum flavor, with a silky, velvety texture and satisfying cinnamon and pepper spice that plays off the fruit. It's a structured and fresh selection.",94,45.0
2428,Williams Selyem,"Brambly red cherry and strawberry are featured among shy layers of oak, providing the wine with an interesting duality of power and silkiness on the palate. A complex streak of minerality makes this intriguingly seductive and exotic, with layers of flavor unfolding with each sip.",94,95.0
2429,Chehalem,"Packaged in a plain, stylish bottle with the RR logo prominently displayed, this reserve-level cuvée brings concentrated flavors of citrus, apple, peach and pear, along with highlights of wet paper, fresh herb and lemongrass. Despite 12 g/L of residual sugar, the finish tilts a bit sour.",89,39.0
2430,Testarossa,"One of four monopole Central Coast bottlings from the Los Gatos winery, this bottling offers rich red cherry, vanilla, rose petal and watermelon scents on the nose. The palate is dry and structured, showing tart Montmorency cherry and hints of licorice and eucalyptus.",92,65.0
2431,Columbia Crest,"The finest Walter Clore since the 2001, this Bordeaux-style blend shows considerable muscle and depth. Built upon firm, cherry-berry fruit, it adds nuances of baking spice, pepper, vanilla wafer and a pleasing earthiness to the tannins. It represents the ultimate expression of Columbia Crest, and the 2005 marks a welcome return to excellence.",90,34.0
2432,Albert Bichot,"A full-bodied wine that is rich and generous. It has spice from new wood, honey and buttered toast, as well as a delicious soft acidity that is mouthwatering. The fat texture introduces an apple and pear finish.",90,
2433,Foxen,"Bright raspberry and fresh-pressed bramble make for a nicely snappy nose that also conveys a touch of rust, graphite and earthiness. Tart cranberry and plum skin mesh into mineral tones of slate and pencil lead, all lifted by bay leaf and dried sage. It needs time to reach full potential.",92,62.0
2434,Kendall-Jackson,"This full-bodied wine is complex and detailed from the spicy perfume to the finish, and rich and satisfying in the middle. Aromas like black tea and rhubarb lead to ripe and deep cherry and slightly tangy raspberry flavors that are lifted by moderate tannins and linger on the finish.",92,20.0
2435,Testarossa,"Welcoming on the nose, this top-end bottling offers aromas of baked red cherry, clove and black plum before diving into crushed graphite, wet slate and loamy mud aromas. Soft on the palate but immediately vibrant with acidity, flavors of dark cranberry and tart cherry are lifted by anise-like spice.",92,80.0
2436,Maryhill,"Here is an interesting take on Viognier, relatively low in alcohol (13%) but quite sweet, at almost 2% residual sugar. The sweetness takes away a fair amount of the interesting citrus character of the grape, and seems to dumb it down a bit, but it might fit in well with spicy Asian dishes.",86,18.0
2437,Lynmar,"Lush enough to drink now, with decanting, but this powerfully ripe Chard will benefit from limited aging. It's explosive in oak-infused pineapple, papaya, peach, green apple and Asian spice flavors, but right now the oak is not integrated with the fruit, making for a disjointed quality. Give it until mid-2008, and for a couple years after.",91,40.0
2438,DFJ Vinhos,"A big textured, smooth wine, sweet fruits with firm tannins finished with dark perfumes. It is a blockbuster, thankfully without high alcohol, balanced in its richness. A barbecue wine, ready to drink now.",89,13.0
2439,Williams Selyem,"Shows lots of acidity and also the firm tannins and tug of dried herbs that always accompany this bottling. Quite good, with fruity flavors of cherries, raspberries, currants and cola, but feels a little rustic. Could harmonize over the next 6–8 years.",92,56.0
2440,Wines & Winemakers,"The creamy, ripe character of Alvarinho is pronounced in this rich wine. Ripe citrus and juicy apricot fruit give a smooth, rounded character that is lightly crispened by its final tangy acidity. Drink from 2017.",88,20.0
2441,Feudi di San Gregorio,"This special wine is aged for 18 months in oak and shows a massively long and intense finish, with evolving notes of black fruit, ash, prune, spice, leather and bitter black chocolate. It showcases the hard work achieved by Feudi di San Gregorio over the years. This should age for 10 years or more.",94,65.0
2442,Casa Santos Lima,"Firmly tannic and dry, this is a textured wine with a strong mineral character. Its dark plum-skin fruitiness is tight, nervy and spicy. A strong tannic element, very dry and firm, pushes forward. It's a wine to drink from 2017.",87,8.0
2443,Bründlmayer,"This has a fleshy core of red cherry fruit and a prominent acidic backbone, making this a satisfying, food-friendly wine.",85,
2444,Concha y Toro,"Creamy oak matches prickly red plum and cherry aromas. This is tight and rugged in feel, with black plum, herb, spice and dry oak flavors. A toasty finish loses its fruit quickly.",85,11.0
2445,Lynmar,"Great Pinot Noir, dry, silky and crisp in acidity, yet with enormously complex flavors. The cherries and pomegranates have an earthy connection by way of minerals and sweet herbs. Only an infant now, this elegantly polished wine should develop over the next six years.",93,70.0
2446,Fess Parker,"Caramelized black currant and dark tobacco leaf aromas make for a rich nose in this bottling from the longtime family producer. The palate packs elderberry and dried violet flavors, with pencil shaving, charred wood and smoky touches. The tannins are full and firm.",90,30.0
2447,Maryhill,"Thin to the verge of being empty of fruit and flavor, this shows no varietal character whatsoever. Green, leafy, herbal and earthy flavors abound.",83,17.0
2448,Montes,"Snappy red-berry aromas are true to the variety, but there's also a leathery, roasted stalkiness to the nose. It feels round, chunky and creamy, with baked berry and toasted flavors. It finishes round, full and creamy in feel, with a peppery note.",87,22.0
2449,Maryhill,"Aged sur lie for 10 months in 100% new French oak, this golden-colored wine leads with aromas of toast, pineapple and peach. The tropical fruit flavors are full bodied and rich with a creamy, almost unctuous feel. It's full-bore but an excellent representation of the style.",90,27.0
2450,Iron Horse,"Midweight in texture and on the palate, this evokes tropical pineapple and stone fruit amid a suggestion of anise. Delightful on its own, it would also be a good companion to light summer salads and seafood, especially dressed in citrus.",88,27.0
2451,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Sourced from Cold Creek and StoneTree vineyards, this spent 20 months in new French oak. The barrel aging puts a big frame of toast and spice around the blueberry/blackberry fruit, and continues into a finish with some unresolved tannins that turn bitter. Give this more time to pull the fruit and barrel flavors together.",88,50.0
2452,Columbia Crest,"Dark, chewy fruit flavors of black cherry come with a generous amount of espresso and dark, smoky toast. Highlights of anise and coffee grounds continue into a finish with slightly grainy tannins.",88,12.0
2453,Chehalem,"A rare grape in Oregon, this is a bright garnet shade and scented with cranberry and raspberry fruit. Acidity brings significant snap to the flavors, so much so that for many tasters it will show best with some greasy/smoky grilled meats. A hint of Band-Aid comes up in the finish, but does not distract.",87,24.0
2454,Georges Duboeuf,"This wine has tight fruit, crisp cherry flavors and acidity. The structure comes from the fruit skins rather than tannins. It is ready to drink.",86,20.0
2455,Maryhill,"Packaged in a distinctive dark blue bottle, this off-dry Muscat gives the scents and flavors you'd expect—heavy on orange and tangerine, with a sweet candy character. That said, it's very well balanced, with good supporting acidity and excellent length.",88,12.0
2456,Maryhill,"Sourced entirely from the Milbrandt vineyards, this is a riot of honey, tea and mint highlights, with excellent acidity and ripe tree fruits. The length and density are outstanding for this price point.",88,10.0
2457,Maryhill,"A blend of Merlot, Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon, this is indeed a sturdy red table wine. The tannins are dense and chewy, the fruit submerged beneath barrel flavors of toast, caramel and nougat. It spent 20 months in 50% new French oak.",87,32.0
2458,Maryhill,"Forward and lightly spicy, this is a good, all-purpose white wine, with bright flavors of apple and pear. It's not a big wine in any way, but perfectly quaffable and right for a wide variety of noodle dishes.",87,12.0
2459,Montes,"This is fresh, with good pungency and a mix of passion fruit and bell pepper aromas. A scouring mouthfeel pulls no punches, while grassy, slightly bitter flavors of arugula and lemon-lime finish citrusy and tangy.",87,13.0
2460,Santa Ema,"Plum and raspberry aromas are fresh, clean and simple. This is a solid, full-bodied Cabernet with currant and plum flavors accented by notes of herbs and spices. A minty, lightly herbal finish feels fresh and healthy.",87,10.0
2461,Louis Jadot,"This wine comes from a small Chardonnay enclave in the predominantly red premier cru of Beaune Grèves. With its intense exotic fruit and apricot flavors, it's both ripe and crisp with acidity. That makes for a delicious reflection of the vintage, needing time to mature. Drink from 2020.",92,65.0
2462,Undurraga,"Leafy, spicy red-berry aromas suggest asphalt. This is pleasant on the palate, with rubbery tannins. Flavors of rose water, raspberry and plum are light and floral, while the finish is easygoing.",86,11.0
2463,Montes,"This Merlot smells rooty, with licorice and mint to boot. A wide, sort of flabby palate is, at its base, oaky as can be; there's also stewed plum and herbal blackberry flavors in front of a blocky, chunky finish.",86,25.0
2464,Santa Ema,"Edgy aromas of plum, cherry and cassis are fresh but scratchy. In the mouth, this Carmenère-led blend shows blazing, cutting acidity and racy flavors of cranberry and pie cherry. Oak and vanilla show up on the finish, which is acidic and fresh, much like the rest of the wine.",86,22.0
2465,Columbia Crest,"There's a suggestion of sweetness underlying this pleasant, crisp and fruity wine. Though labeled 100% Sauvignon Blanc, it does little to showcase varietal character. However, as a fruit-forward, quaffable white, it works quite nicely.",86,8.0
2466,DFJ Vinhos,"Ripe and generous, this is a rich, full-bodied wine. While there are still young tannins, the wine is more about rich black fruits, dark plum skins and final acidity. It needs some more time, so drink from 2016.",88,12.0
2467,DFJ Vinhos,"An intriguing blend of grapes, bringing ripe, smooth Chardonnay up against crisp, green Alvarinho. It will work, once the wine has settled down and integrated. It's fresh, with crisp citrus and ripe apricot flavors, all shot through by acidity. Drink from 2016.",88,10.0
2468,Fess Parker,"Judged as medium-sweet on the international scale, this shows petrol and lime Jell-o on the nose. The palate is not overly sweet but certainly not dry, offering honeyed lemon curds and sugared lime-peel flavors.",88,15.0
2469,Fess Parker,"A touch of vanilla, butter and seared lemons characterize the nose of this wine that also shows pears and apples, making it a solid Chardonnay alternative. The palate offers a hint of marzipan along with juicy lemon pulp and zest as well as richer stone-fruit elements in the midpalate.",88,28.0
2470,V. Sattui,"Full bodied and richly textured, this is a generous wine, resplendent in tangy caramel apple and wild vanilla. Soft on the palate, it leans tropical, with a taste of pineapple, guava and even coconut, plus a slight suggestion of nutmeg-like spice at the end.",88,35.0
2471,Kendall-Jackson,Apples and pears in the aroma lead to easygoing fruit flavors and a soft broad texture in this medium-bodied fruit-forward wine. Hints of butter and vanilla sneak in on the finish.,87,15.0
2472,Maryhill,"The high-toned aromas of raspberry, barrel spice and herb bring a touch of heat along with them. The palate offers tart tangy acidity, with the tannins seeming a bit bunched up.",87,36.0
2473,Maryhill,"Wood-spice aromas are at the fore followed by red fruit, with the wine also showing a fair amount of heat. The cranberry, raspberry and oak flavors are full bodied, seeming a bit boozy.",87,24.0
2474,Undurraga,"Dusty, earthy plum and berry aromas are a touch leafy and suggestive of sea shells. A fresh palate features enough body to handle racy acidity, while this tastes of plum, brown sugar and spicy oak. A steady finish turns over no new stones.",87,14.0
2475,Testarossa,"Heavy and seemingly sweet, this has the taste of black raspberry syrup and melted red licorice.",85,18.0
2476,Santa Ema,"Berry and currant aromas are jumpy and fruity in nature, while in the mouth, creamy oak creates a sticky feel. Candied, barrel-driven flavors of vanilla and clove outlast the wine's fruit content on the finish.",86,15.0
2477,Santa Ema,"Simple but friendly aromas of green fruits and spring vegetables set up a lemony feeling palate, with flavors of lime, green apple and herbs. This shows pyrazines on a juicy finish, but not so much that the wine comes across green, vegetal or bitter.",86,10.0
2478,Maryhill,"The reserve seems to have spent more time in barrel, bearing a chocolatey finish, but otherwise it is quite similar to the Marryhill's regular Sangiovese. Slightly higher alcohol makes for a bit more concentration of the strawberry fruit, but the herbal, peppery bite is still there in the finish.",86,20.0
2479,Casa Santos Lima,"You could think of this wine as an exclamation. It is certainly rich and generous with its bold black fruits and dark tannins. There is a juicy component to the wine as well, spicy and full of berry flavors. It is ready to drink.",89,15.0
2480,Trapiche,"This Malbec is strangely exotic, with unusual floral aromas that blend in Middle Eastern spices including cardamom. Massive and borderline over-extracted, this tastes earthy and baked, with herbal blackberry flavors. A blackened, peppery flavor dominates a finish that comes across as stewed.",89,55.0
2481,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"This is a nicely balanced, tightly constructed effort, a Merlot that will surprise anyone who has not tasted Washington Merlot in this price range. It is miles apart from the herbal, stemmy Merlots of other New World regions, or the vapid, watery $15 junk that comes from our neighbor to the south. This is ripe, full, meaty, structured, laden with plum and cherry, spice and just a hint of herb.",89,16.0
2482,Kendall-Jackson,"Big mountain fruit here throws powerful aromas of ripe plum, thyme and bacon, while full-scale oaking yields maple aromas, vanilla flavors, and coffee on the finish. The wood element is a little weighty at this point, but there's solid fruit to support it.",90,45.0
2483,Chehalem,"Just a touch of residual sugar (11 g/L) softens up the edges of this wine, which brings flavors of tart lemon, grapefruit pith and wet paper into play. Try it with prawns, shellfish or non-spicy noodle dishes.",88,29.0
2484,Chehalem,"Done entirely in stainless tanks, this fruity wine offers spring fresh flavors of citrus, pineapple and green melon. With barely perceptible residual sugar, the acids keep it lip-smacking and lively. There is just a hint of buttery caramel at the core.",88,19.0
2485,Louis Latour,"A Journal is an old Burgundian measurement for just under one acre. From a portion of this Grand Cru vineyard, this wine is perfumed, powerful and has great concentration. Already it is showing dark fruits, ripe plum and good texture. Acidity cuts through the wine, giving a great lift at the end. Drink from 2022.",94,580.0
2486,Louis Latour,"This wine has all the tight minerality of the appellation, surrounded by delicious, ripe yellow and white fruits. The wood aging is still there although balanced with the richness and the intensity of the wine. It is going to develop well. Drink from 2020.",93,100.0
2487,Louis Jadot,"A dense, firm selection, this has layers of red fruits and acids that help to give the wine's skeleton some flesh. This is likely to develop into a rich, but always firm, wine.",88,65.0
2488,Albert Bichot,"This is a textured, dense and concentrated selection that has notes of white fruits and white flowers. It's a wine for medium-term aging.",88,
2489,Gary Farrell,"A light, refreshing and yet complex combination of fresh-cut grapefruit and watermelon, a suggestion of apricot and cranberry in the wings, this wine is stellar in every way. Fermented in both stainless steel and neutral oak it provides a textured acidity that gives it balance and just enough weight, finishing with a taste of wet stone.",91,28.0
2490,Georges Duboeuf,"Rich and full in the mouth, this still-young wine also has a good structure. It is dark and dense, smoky over the red-berry fruits. Concentrated fruit and tannins give a solid base for the wine's ripe, aromatic character. Drink from 2017.",91,20.0
2491,Georges Duboeuf,"This has the structure expected from a wine in Moulin-à-Vent. It is dense, with a dry, dark core of tannins. The acidity, red plums and black-currant fruit characteristics give the potential for freshness along with a ripe future. Drink from 2017.",91,27.0
2492,Iron Horse,"This wine is both refined and robust, from a three-acre block replanted in 2007. It is aged in older French barrels, with the fruit sultry in cherry and black tea, the tension of the acidity hard to shake which contributes to its overall softness and complex intensity.",91,85.0
2493,V. Sattui,"Aged in new French, American and seasoned oak, this vineyard-designate is soft and spicy with thick, abundant layers of grilled meat, sizzling cinnamon and dark brown sugar. Full-bodied and robustly concentrated, it maintains a thread of acidity that allows it to stay fresh despite its power and ripeness.",91,42.0
2494,Kunde,"Buttered toast and vanilla flavors are accompanied by pear, mango and Meyer lemon fruitiness in this Chardonnay. It's crisp with acidity but rich and satisfying.",88,18.0
2495,Kunde,"This is a low-production wine sourced from a single block in the winery's estate vineyard. It has a modest oak influence and brisk acidity. The wine is easy to like with tart papaya, lime, peach and vanilla flavors.",88,22.0
2496,Casa Santos Lima,"The name of this wine comes from the landscape of the vineyard with its ancient rocks and fossilized remains. It is soft, smooth and spicy, with bold, ripe flavors and a touch of vanilla from the wood aging. This is generous, full of fruit and ready to drink.",89,13.0
2497,Trapiche,"Trapiche is doing all sorts of experiments with terroirs and soils, and this Malbec is from vineyards planted on top of clay. On the nose, it's oaky, with notes of clove, mint and barrel spice accenting black-fruit scents. A full chewy palate deals spicy oaky minty blackberry flavors in front of a chocolaty finish with wood spice and minty berry notes. Drink through 2019.",90,20.0
2498,Casa Santos Lima,"This ripe, concentrated and structured wine is produced from old vines. Blackberry fruits and rich tannins give it a dry core. The acidity and the final balance suggest that this wine should age further. Drink from late 2017.",90,25.0
2499,Louis Latour,"The biggest of the Latour Meursaults, with extra layers of ripe fruit and nuances of toast and nuts extending into a textured, lengthy finish. Focused and elegant.",90,55.0
2500,Robert Mondavi,"At the bottom end of our range, this stalwart is tightly wound and fairly driven. Plum and cassis on the palate offer just the slightest nuance of cured Italian meat. Coffee is dominant on the long, linear finish. Now it's pretty dark and unevolved. Patience will be rewarded.",90,29.0
2501,Louis Latour,"Rounded, soft and gentle, it has attractive tropical fruit flavors along with a touch of lime to give crispness. Ready to drink.",86,21.0
2502,Foxen,"This single-vineyard wine from Foxen's estate is a little too sweet. It seems to contain residual sugar, to judge by the jellied pineapple and apricot flavors. If you don't mind that, you'll find a crisply acidic, clean wine, with oak and lees complexities.",86,34.0
2503,V. Sattui,"Superripe, almost sweet, this has good acidity and firm, fuzzy tannins that help balance the jammy cherry, raspberry and cola flavors. Good with a slightly sweet barbecue sauce on ribs and chicken.",86,29.0
2504,Siduri,"Deep purple fruits, black sage, big cherry and woody spices arise from this wine by Adam Lee, who recently sold to Jackson Family Wines but will remain in charge. The palate shows crushed clove and allspice, licorice, graphite and more dark fruit flavors.",90,33.0
2505,Testarossa,"Quite dark in the glass, this bottling has a nose that suggests boysenberry, blackberry and black cherry. The dense aromas are livened up by iron, black loam, Indian spice and black-tea notes. The same range of dark fruits power the palate, especially black plums, and the rich and tangy flavors are nuanced with black sage, bergamot and eucalyptus notes.",93,66.0
2506,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"Burgundy producer Aegerter has come up with a bright and breezy Provence rosé whose style sums up the lighter side of these wines. It is fruity, fresh, very clean and crisp.",86,17.0
2507,Undurraga,"Leathery and horsey on the nose, with cherry fruit and warmth. The palate has some edge and bite to it, with lean tannins in support of generic raspberry and standard herbal flavors. Quick and cleansing on the finish, with another wave of herbal flavor.",84,13.0
2508,Chehalem,"As with all the 2013 white wines from Chehalem, the alcohol is way down and the acids up in this blend of the three estate vineyards. All-stainless fermented, it's quite tart with green apple and grapefruit flavors dominating.",87,22.0
2509,Columbia Crest,"The Two Vines Chardonnay is simple, clean and reliable. Suggestions of green apple and white peach appear on the palate.",85,8.0
2510,Albert Bichot,"This is a firm wine, but it has ripe red fruit. It shows an attractive touch of smoke, and there is fine balance between the firm tannins and fragrant fruit. Drink now.",85,
2511,Concha y Toro,"Powdery, wayward aromas pick up more raciness and green character with time in the glass. A linear palate flat-lines at lime and green apple in terms of flavors, while the finish brings a slightly vegetal tone.",86,17.0
2512,Testarossa,"One of the single-vineyard-focused winery's more affordable appellation blends, this is a plush, velvety wine with aromas of black cherry, cola, roasted fennel and a touch of graphite. The palate starts quite earthy, with thyme and rosemary notes, then winds to tart cherry fruit that's lively and long-lasting.",89,45.0
2513,Fess Parker,"Plump blackberries, sweet violets and a slight brushing of tar show on the nose of this straightforward, everything-you-expect Syrah. Bright acidity contains the dark fruit on the palate, with dense blackberries and elderberries dusted by black pepper and a touch of thyme.",88,28.0
2514,Siduri,"Shows the dark, extracted richness and full body of Pinot Noirs from this Monterey County appellation. The flavors of cherries, cola and mushu plum sauce are exceptionally powerful, almost sweet in the finish. Drink now, after a brief decant.",88,30.0
2515,Bründlmayer,"Strongly perfumed and packed with both acidity and sweetness, this is a memorably refreshing and delicious wine. With its honey, lemon zest and apple flavors, it is bright, light and ready to drink. Screwcap.",89,
2516,Albert Bichot,"From one of the largets premier crus from the left bank of Chablis, this is ripe and full in the mouth, although with a cooler nervy texture that gives attractive fresh acidity. It has a bright and fruity character, just hinting at a touch of toast from the 10% wood aging. Drink from 2016.",92,
2517,Williams Selyem,"Juicy strawberries and plum are cut with allspice and star anise on the sharply spiced nose of this wine from one of the Golden State's legendary producers. The palate shows the juice of darker berries, from blackberries to black cherries, with an Earl Grey tea bitterness and dried sage complexity.",92,39.0
2518,Fess Parker,"This winery produces a slew of Pinot Noirs each year, and this specific clonal study shows clove and cardamom on the somewhat subdued nose. The flavors are more forward, dominated by black tea and cherry, with a touch of tannin.",89,55.0
2519,Testarossa,"This is a big, rich Chardonnay, another monster lineup in Testarossa's single-vineyard series. Shows tightly knit apple and peach flavors very generously oaked, with the requisite additions of smoke, vanilla, and woody spices. There's something minerally in the middle that seems likely to preserve the wine, if you wish to age it. Very fine quality, and a super-good food wine.",92,35.0
2520,Robert Mondavi,"Smooth and distinguished, a flamboyant wine with enough flavor to last all day. Peaches, pears and tropical fruits are encased in lush, toasty oak, while lees adds a creamy, mealy texture. This classy wine is rich and balanced.",91,38.0
2521,Robert Mondavi,"Certainly a bigger, denser wine than the Carneros Pinot. The plummy-berry flavors are wrapped in sturdy, rich tannins, with extra notes of earth and herbs. Feels weighty on the palate, a wine of importance, not to mention elegance. The density suggests meats on the bone.",91,50.0
2522,Columbia Crest,"Though Columbia Crest is widely available, the reserve tier is not. Just a few hundred cases of this reserve were made, done in an oaky, buttered popcorn style. Think California with more acidity.",88,25.0
2523,Montes,"Passion fruit, lettuce, grapefruit and tropical aromas get this Sauvignon Blanc off to a nice start. Zesty, speedy and super fresh on the palate, with blazing acidity, this tastes of passion fruit, green herbs and grass, especially on a racy, slightly pithy finish.",89,16.0
2524,Robert Mondavi,"Shows the classic structure of Oakville, with impeccably ripe tannins, and the winemaker's touch of oak is deft. The black currant flavors could use a bit more concentration, though, as there's a stubborn thinness throughout.",86,45.0
2525,Undurraga,"Lavishly oaked, the fruit here struggles to make itself acknowledged, and when it does it is light plum-cranberry in aroma and flavor. Quite dry on the palate, the wine finishes tart with woody tannins.",81,12.0
2526,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Many people feel Fiano represents southern Italy’s most promising white grape, and after tasting this rendition, who can argue? The flavor package is pineapple, citrus and wet stones. The structure and mouthfeel are what many Italian whites strive for but never reach. An elegant wine.",91,20.0
2527,Montes,"A lot of ripe apple, creamy butter and pear aromas make for a friendly opening, while the palate is plump and weighty, with toasty melon, citrus and buttered pear flavors. Tropical throughout, but with character and toasty spice on the finish. Ready to drink.",88,24.0
2528,Williams Selyem,"A sip is all it takes to fall in love with this potent Pinot Noir. Big tannins and crisp acidity make it hard to appreciate now, but there's a gigantic core of cherries and raspberries, with a firm minerality from the soil. Will develop bottle complexity over the years. Don't even think of popping the cork before 2015.",95,56.0
2529,Williams Selyem,"From the winery's own Westside Road vineyard, formerly called Litton, comes this grandiose, if immature, Pinot Noir. In its youth it's all about primary, jammy raspberry and cherry fruit. On the edges are fine acidity, smooth tannins and a perfect appliqué of oak. Shows the hallmarks of this great, emerging vineyard, but needs serious time to come around. Try after 2015.",95,100.0
2530,Williams Selyem,"Soft and ripe enough to drink now, after a decent decanting, it shows pure raspberry, blueberry and cherry fruit flavors, subtlely accented with cola and baking spices, and all of it wrapped into thick but smooth tannins. Good as it is, it will gain traction over the next 15 years.",95,75.0
2531,Montes,"Aromas of white peach and apple come with mild oak notes. This feels melony and full, with its body weight dictated by tropical fruits. Briny, salty tropical fruit and corn flavors finish with a lasting note of oak.",89,22.0
2532,Fess Parker,"This bottling from the family's estate vineyard in the Foxen Canyon area rides the gamy side of the grape, with sizzling lamb crust, rosemary, black pepper and lavender on the nose. Dense elderberry fruit shows on the palate, with touches of asphalt, chopped thyme and more purple flowers. The acidity is balanced, and the tannins are firm but approachable. A touch of vanilla marks the finish.",93,49.0
2533,Chehalem,"Chehalem makes four different Rieslings, and this is often the best of them. Rich and complex, it's dense with grapefruit, lemon, lime, apple and flavors of wet stone. Lovely in the mouth, it lingers gracefully through the finish.",91,29.0
2534,Chehalem,"This block selection shows a delicate, elegant touch in this vintage, opening with pretty floral accents and continuing with light but compelling flavors of citrus and honeysuckle. There is a well-tuned bitter streak, presumably from some skin contact, and a refreshing minerality throughout.",91,29.0
2535,Kendall-Jackson,"A bit heavy and creamy, but there's something exotic about the oily, fat richness that suggests cashew nuts. With Meyer lemon flavors, it's an unctuous wine, and a very good value.",90,15.0
2536,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"A rich style of Pinot Blanc, bringing out a more spicy character of baked apples and nutmeg. The wine has richness, feeling full in the mouth, rounded and soft.",87,24.0
2537,Fess Parker,"Here's a good Pinot to drink now from this esteemed producer. It's dry and easy to like, with raspberry and cherry flavors, wrapped into spicy oak.",87,28.0
2538,DFJ Vinhos,"This ripe, structured blend of Tinta Roriz and Touriga Nacional is full of black fruits. The texture behind the tannins is smooth with an immediate juicy character. There is a perfumed, ripe aftertaste that makes the wine ready to drink now.",89,8.0
2539,DFJ Vinhos,"A structured, full wine, a blend of Syrah and Touriga Nacional, that has ripe black fruits that are beautifully perfumed. It layers this ripe fruit with intense acidity that gives the wine a fresh while full-bodied character. With a little more aging, this will be impressive. Drink from 2017.",89,15.0
2540,Foxen,"Very approachable and easygoing aromatics invite the nose with salted lime, yellow apples and buttery strudel scents. The palate is equally smooth and tasty, with warm apple and lemon-brioche flavors and a creamy mouthfeel. This is a full-body take on the grape rather than lean and grassy.",89,28.0
2541,Gary Farrell,"Light and floral, this is a complex, well-integrated Chardonnay that's bursting in just-sliced pineapple, with a layering of butterscotch and caramel. It's richly textured yet nicely balanced between savory and sweet. The acidity upholds the wine from entering into dense territory, a celebration of one heck of a sunny vintage in a glass.",93,45.0
2542,Iron Horse,"This estate Chardonnay is keeping stylistically with the winery's other offerings, though a tad weightier and richer in oak and crème brûlée. Fresh peach, pineapple and anise intermingle on the palate, with a silky yet complex texture. There is a palate-refreshing hint of lime on the finish.",93,29.0
2543,Iron Horse,"Steely in wet stone and high-toned citrus, this Chardonnay is from Hyde-Old Wente clones and deftly made in a light style that doesn't skimp on delicious complexity. Apple and herb figure prominently, as does a remarkable mouthfeel of minerality, a testament to the winery's cool growing sites.",93,48.0
2544,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Feudi di San Gregorio consistently does a terrific job with the Fiano grape. The producer finds a magical way of extracting the grape's pear, citrus and peach aromas. Mineral and talc powder sensations are there as well.",89,20.0
2545,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"From one of the villages that lies behind the primary Chardonnay vineyards of the Côte de Beaune, this is already smooth, fruity and perfumed. It has attractive acidity and a rich, baked apple character that is pointed up by the layer of toastiness. Drink now, although the wine will be better from 2017.",88,46.0
2546,Concha y Toro,"Hard spice, juniper and minty aromas meld with chocolate and blackberry scents. This is chewy and full on the palate, with spicy, minty blackberry and black currant flavors that finish thick, with a woodsy, lightly green aftertaste.",87,11.0
2547,Wines & Winemakers,"Structured with typical tight Douro tannins, this wine is still very young. Red fruits are backed by tough tannins and a juicy aftertaste. Fresh and fruity. the wine has enough tannin to age. Drink from 2016.",87,12.0
2548,Chehalem,"Another beautifully crafted wine from Chehalem, this combines inviting citrus, melon and papaya fruit with just the right amount of buttered popcorn flavors from new oak. Silky and elegant, it is delicious now but will cellar well.",90,19.0
2549,Louis Latour,"A bit tighter than some of the other wines, even showing some sulfur aromas that gradually ease up. Toasty wood notes accent pear and lime fruit, developing into dried spice nuances on the long, minerally finish.",89,44.0
2550,Louis Latour,"In contrast to many of the other wines, this one starts off tight, with only faint lime and mineral notes on the nose. But it blossoms with air, stubbornly yielding up taut citrus flavors that flow over the palate with an almost gritty, powdered-rock texture.",89,40.0
2551,Gary Farrell,"Here's a very tight, young Pinot, one you'll want to put some bottle age on. It's marked by acids and oak flavors that have not yet been integrated into the underlying fruit. Give it through 2008, by which time the smoky wood and vanilla should marry with the cherries and Dr. Pepper flavors to produce a rich, complex sipper.",91,50.0
2552,Gary Farrell,"The vineyard is relatively new, and the block from which this wine was made is entirely Dijon clone 777. It's a rich, fruit-forward wine, brimming with crushed cherry pulp and black raspberries, to which charred oak barrels have lent richer notes of mocha. The wine also is quite dry and acidic and even tannic, in Farrell's usual style. That should lend it ageworthiness.",91,50.0
2553,Columbia Crest,"This new lineup from Columbia Crest features fruit exclusively from the Horse Heaven Hills AVA, which provides a welcome focus to the wines. Fruit-powered, but more substantial than either the Grand Estates or the Two Vines, this shows persistent flavors of tangy raspberry and blackberry, moderate acids and plenty of cocoa in the finish.",88,15.0
2554,Casa Santos Lima,"Wood aging shows strongly throughout this wine. With its blend of Viosinho, Encruzado with a dash of Chardonnay, it has weight and richness. A creamy character comes from the wood and the ripe yellow fruits are developing well. Hold to 2015.",90,
2555,Columbia Crest,"Pineapple and mango aromas mix with notes of baking spices. The flavors show a fine sense of balance, tapering toward the finish. It's oak driven at times but provides a lot of enjoyment.",87,12.0
2556,Georges Duboeuf,"Full and rich, this single-estate wine is generous and ripe. Spice and yellow-fruit flavors are right up front, giving the wine generosity. Good balancing acidity offers the lift the wine needs. Drink now.",90,38.0
2557,Trapiche,"Average red juice with sweet, rubbery aromas and flavors that match. It's Malbec in its most simple state: raspberry and cherry distilled into a quaffable liquid. Chilling might help.",83,7.0
2558,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"A good value in the world of Zind-Humbrecht wines, this off-dry Gewürztraminer is super-concentrated, with a silky texture and flavors of lychees and cling peaches. A nice white cherry accent kicks in on the medium finish. Try with Thai fare.",90,48.0
2559,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Pure Cabernet sourced principally from the Cold Creek Vineyard, this instantly accessible reserve plays out broadly across the palate, with black cherry, caramel and creamy coffee flavors in abundance. Hints of graphite and chalk carry through the tannins and into the well-defined, balanced finish.",90,48.0
2560,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Clean and fresh, this juicy wine carries a bit of fruit sweetness, but the flavors are tilted toward minerality rather than fruitiness. It's wonderfully refreshing, with a mix of citrus rind, melon and white peach working into an extended, palate-cleansing finish.",90,10.0
2561,Robert Mondavi,"Pungent clove and cinnamon appear upon entry to this medium-bodied wine, which also offers smooth, rounded tannins and subtle oak. Plum, raspberry and tobacco all make an appearance, finished off by a healthy dose of black pepper.",88,23.0
2562,Santa Ema,"Leesy, toasty opening aromas accent melon, flower blossom and stone fruit scents. This is woody but healthy in feel, with acidic lift. Flavors of resiny, briny melon and peach finish with a wave of barrel-driven vanilla, but overall this shows coastal freshness and proper balance.",89,24.0
2563,Robert Mondavi,"Cherry compote and a flair of kirsch preside over well-tended acidity in this full-bodied wine. Earthy lavender and herb give the wine an ethereal character atop solid, velvety texture and a big oak finish.",88,65.0
2564,Casa Santos Lima,"A Santos Lima estate-grown blend of Shiraz and Touriga Nacional, this is a ripe, spicy wine that shows its wood aging strongly. Rich tannins and red fruits are melded with acidity and a juicy, fruity aftertaste. Drink now.",88,20.0
2565,Wines & Winemakers,"Soft and fruity, this is a ripe style of rosé. It's dry and peppery, with fresh acidity cutting through its rounded texture. It's a rosé for food, with a full aftertaste.",85,11.0
2566,Santa Ema,"Electric purple in color, this powerful wine opens with jammy, loud aromas of boysenberry and herbal qualities. Likewise, spunky berry flavors are herbal in nature. Minty oak and medicinal notes dominate a rubbery, long finish.",85,12.0
2567,Santa Ema,"Intense, compact aromas feed into a big, tannic palate with monster fruit that's fairly herbal in character. This is a pounding wine that eschews elegance for black-fruit power, and along the way it's rubbery and a bit scratchy.",85,15.0
2568,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Blackberry jam aromas are followed by fleshy and full dark-fruit flavors, surrounded by a layer of fine grained tannins. It provides a lot of quality and value.",89,15.0
2569,Testarossa,"Smoked raspberry, mulberry, rust, slate and a bright hibiscus touch show on the nose of this appellation blend, which tends to be more widely available than the winery's single-vineyard expressions. Cranberry fruit meets with rocky minerality on the palate, as wild herbs add to the complexity.",89,48.0
2570,Maryhill,The medium-sweet stone-fruit and orange-peel flavors are direct and bring appeal. It goes down easy.,86,14.0
2571,Williams Selyem,"Previous bottlings from this vineyard have been much better. This vintage is intensely ripe, almost Port-like, with cherry pie, cola and red currant flavors, and a hit of sweet oak. The acidity is just fine, but the wine lacks subtlety.",87,59.0
2572,Montes,"Earthy, baked aromas of ripe berry, raisin and leather come with a tobacco note. This is nice given the cold weather that drove the 2011 vintage. Round tannins and overall balance provide bedding for spicy flavors of blackberry, herbal notes, licorice and oak.",88,25.0
2573,DFJ Vinhos,"With some tannins and structure, this is still a juicy, red-berry-flavored wine. Acidity and the lightly dry core give shape to the bright, ripe fruitiness. Drink now.",84,10.0
2574,Wines & Winemakers,"An intensely orange-pink-colored wine, this is a blend of the local Castelão with Touriga Nacional and Syrah. Its acidity is filled out with ripe red-berry fruits and a smooth texture of vanilla. The wine is soft and ready to drink.",84,12.0
2575,Wines & Winemakers,This is a stalky wine with dry tannins under the wild blackberry fruits. It has a green edge to it that spoils its fruitiness.,83,11.0
2576,Gary Farrell,"The winemaker took a Chardonnay approach, giving the wine lots of barrel fermentation and lees aging. The result is a rich, softly textured 100% Sauvignon Blanc, with lime, kiwi and vanilla flavors, wrapped into a creamy, buttery mouthfeel.",87,25.0
2577,Georges Duboeuf,"With toasty wood-aging flavors, this is a rich, spicy wine. It has a note of nutmeg to balance the citrus- and apricot-like acidity and the ripe depth of flavor.",87,24.0
2578,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"An elegant wine, with nicely framed red berry fruit flavors. Hints of dried herbs and modest tannins put everything in balanced proportion.",88,18.0
2579,Iron Horse,"A beautiful wine, in the Iron Horse style, with plenty of ripe fruit balanced with crisp acidity. The lime, strawberry and raspberry flavors have a pleasantly yeasty edge, with a slightly sweet finish.",88,38.0
2580,Kunde,"Lots of spicy Zin flavors in this affordable wine. It's soft and rich, yet dry, with briary blackberry, black currant, cocoa and spice flavors that finish with a warm headiness.",87,20.0
2581,Siduri,"Lush and vibrantly balanced, this wine is marked by juicy layers of blueberry, huckleberry and spicy cola and clove. Velvety-smooth on the palate, it's a satisfying, medium-bodied effort that effectively shows the beauty of the site and the vintage.",93,52.0
2582,Robert Mondavi,"They say the grapes come from Lake, Napa, Sonoma, and Mendocino counties. There are some pretty good black-currant and oak aromas, but the flavors are thin and sharp. It’s well made, as you’d expect. Still, the overall impression is lean and austere.",83,13.0
2583,Robert Mondavi,"This is a very light Pinot Noir. The tannins are soft, as you’d expect, and the flavors tend toward sun-dried tomatoes, herbs and hard spices, with a suggestion of plums, but otherwise there’s not much fruit. It’s a country-style wine, rugged and rough around the edges.",83,12.0
2584,Chehalem,"Delightfully piercing and pungent, the brambly bouquet features a little oak-driven caramel to soften up the leather and smoke elements. The mouthfeel is big and cushy, and at first there’s lots of vanillin on the red-fruit palate. With breathing, it really opens up and comes together, showing complexity and style galore. Drink now or within three years.",93,39.0
2585,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Made with Piedirosso and Aglianico, this young juicy red opens with aromas of fragrant purple flower, dark berry, clove and a tarry note. The fresh easy-drinking palate doles out mouthfuls of red cherry, raspberry and brown pepper alongside soft tannins. Enjoy soon.",88,20.0
2586,Montes,"This electric-pink rosé of Syrah opens with aromas of yeast, chewing gum and pie cherry. The palate is on the full side, but it's not flabby or awkward. Citric flavors are more generic than specific, while this finishes with a burst of preserving acidity and then a lasting note of spent yeast.",88,16.0
2587,Trapiche,"The Oak Cask in the name is evident in the bacon, vanilla and creamy berry aromas that open things up. The palate, however, is fairly acidic, making the fruit taste bright and feel zesty. Flavors of cherry and plum are distinctly red in character, and the finish is quick and lean.",85,13.0
2588,Testarossa,"Just delicious. Superrich in pineapple, white peach and sweet lemon pie fruit, with crème brûlée and buttered toast complexities, its opulence is balanced by crisp acidity. The finish turns unexpectedly dry and clean. Very fine, a wonderfully grown wine from this great vineyard.",93,39.0
2589,Testarossa,"Really delicious, a sweet, spicy, fruity wine that's like biting into a raspberry, roasted almond, vanilla and cinnamon granola candy bar. That's no insult. The wine is dry and wonderfully rich in smooth tannins, and enormously complex. Worthy of very fine steak, lamb, tuna and salmon entrees.",93,59.0
2590,Testarossa,"Although this Pinot is captivatingly rich in raspberry and cherry pie filling, red currant and Dr. Pepper cola flavors, it also has fine acidity and smooth, complex tannins, and a lovely overlay of sweet, smoky oak. Good as it is, there's no reason why it shouldn't develop bottle complexity over the next six years.",93,59.0
2591,Robert Mondavi,"Pithy, with grapefruit and lemon peel flavors, this wine is deceptively crisp and light on the nose, offering a wealth of body and lushness on the palate, accented with nutmeg and peach. It includes 4% Sémillon, partly from the winery's beloved To Kalon vineyard.",90,20.0
2592,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"For a few dollars more than the regular CSM Cabernet, the Indian Wells delivers extra density and complexity. It holds firm, dark fruits and is slightly grainy, but well-ripened tannins carry the wine, and it's less dependent upon oak treatments and flavors of vanilla and cream. Persistent and substantial, it's offers good value, and often sells for less than the listed price.",89,18.0
2593,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"A return to 100% varietal Pinot Gris, this is done in a vivid, leesy style, with excellent texture and depth of flavor. Clean and fresh herb, celery, jicama and melon flavors abound, just hinting at white peach at the far end of its gentle ripeness. The flavor penetration and overall crisp definition are very fine.",89,11.0
2594,Robert Mondavi,"Here's an average-quality Merlot. It's properly dry and firmed up with rich tannins. Yet it's a bit soft, with herbs and oak framing modest cherry and currant flavors.",85,23.0
2595,Fess Parker,"This is too oaky, with dominating aromas and flavors of butterscotch, buttered toast and vanilla. The oak-derived tannins are discernable, but the underlying wine is dry and crisp, with flavors of raspberries and cherries. Drink now.",85,50.0
2596,Wines & Winemakers,"Produced in the vineyards of Estremoz, the marble capital of Portugal, this wine is a ready-to-drink blend of red fruits and soft tannins. A juicy character gives it a crisp aftertaste. Drink the wine now.",87,9.0
2597,Chehalem,"In comparison with other new releases from the winery, this seems dilute. With its watery raspberry fruit and astringent acidity, it lacks the stuffing to handle the 55% new oak it was aged in, making the barrel flavors apparent. More time in the bottle may help.",87,50.0
2598,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"The Chateau's reserve is not their best Chardonnay (that honor belongs to the Cold Creek) but it's their most accessible, made in a powerful, lush style with softer fruit and more obvious new oak. Fleshy, full-bodied and showing lively spice, it's a drink-me-now pleasure.",90,31.0
2599,DFJ Vinhos,"This is a very Douro blend for this wine from Lisboa region. It brings structure and minerality to fill out the dark-black fruits. With ripe tannins and bright acidity balancing the fruit, it is ready to drink.",88,13.0
2600,Foxen,"This is the most expensive Pinot Noir Foxen has ever made, and guess what? It's also the winery's best. It bears rich flavors, offering tiers of smoky cherries, red currants, licorice candies, vanilla, sandalwood and spices. What's harder to describe is the sheer beauty of the texture and balance. Containing the explosive richness of a wine like this is a challenge, but winemaker Bill Wathan has managed to bring elegance to its power. The wine is high in alcohol, and it's not advisable to age it beyond 3 or 4 years, but it is incredibly delicious.",96,85.0
2601,Chanson Père et Fils,"Following an unfortunate Chanson white wine style, this wine is totally dominated by new, high toast wood. It shows freshness, but the acidity comes from the wood, leaving the structured fruit way behind.",85,105.0
2602,Concha y Toro,"Comfortable enough, with common aromas of black fruit, spice, earth and leather. Given that production on this wine is now a whopping million cases, anything palatable should be considered a success. Casillero has reasonably good plum, cassis and brambly flavors, with a hint of oak in support. The mouthfeel is narrow, but overall the wine tastes real.",85,12.0
2603,Chehalem,"Black fruits—raspberry, cherry and plum—mingle with clean earth, cinnamon and chocolate. The wine has grip and power, though currently some excess acidity pokes through the finish.",89,50.0
2604,Kendall-Jackson,"Stature is K-J's top Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend, and can come from any of the winery's vineyards. The '03 hails from Atlas Peak, Mount Veeder and Knights Valley. The wine is immaculate and impeccable, with impressive black currant, cedar, pencil lead and smoky vanilla aromas and flavors that finish with a great deal of complexity and interest. So balanced, so lush, it just dazzles. Drink now through 2012 or thereabouts. Winery only.",95,95.0
2605,Georges Duboeuf,"The wine is produced from a 15-acre parcel of 60-year-old vines. With concentration as well as juicy acidity, the wine is structured and needing to age for a few months. Red currant and berry fruits are shot through with a mineral aftertaste. Drink from 2018.",88,20.0
2606,Georges Duboeuf,This is an especially rich wine. It has almost a surplus of structure and ripe black fruits. The powerful nature of the wine is balanced by the shot of acidity that keeps it crisp. The aftertaste is full bodied and likely to age for a while. Drink this cru from late 2017.,88,20.0
2607,Lynmar,"A terrific California blush wine, rich and compelling, with a gorgeous color, sort of a salmon-koi gold. It's bone dry and crisply clean in acidity, with strong, but not heavy, flavors of strawberries and raspberries. There's a dusting of tannins that give the wine a solid structure.",92,22.0
2608,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"This entry-level Riesling from Zind-Humbrecht is very fresh, crisp, aromatic and delightfully fragrant. Some tighter minerality adds nerviness to the texture, but it's ready to drink.",88,30.0
2609,Wines & Winemakers,"An intense wine. it has a cool feel from its 900-foot-high vineyards. Plenty of acidity keeps it fresh and fruity, bringing out flavors of black currant as well as spicy wood. It could age a year, so wait until 2015.",87,11.0
2610,Wines & Winemakers,"This is an attractive, fruity, fresh rosé. It is dry but balances acidity and fruitiness with its sweet strawberry fruit and light touch of vanilla pod. Drink now.",87,12.0
2611,DFJ Vinhos,"DFJ's venture into the Alentejo has produced a full-bodied wine packed with ripe plums and berry fruits. Tannins are rich, integrated into the fruits. A touch of earthiness needs to blow off before the wine is ready to drink in 2015.",87,9.0
2612,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"The nose is still closed and gives away little. The palate has a voluptuous shape but comes tightly corseted: all is present but still closely held. The peachy fruit has a serene easy sweetness that has its perfect counter measure in orange and Meyer lemon freshness. This is poised and sweet but countered and cut by immense freshness. The aromas have yet to unfold fully. Both blood orange and peach lurk promisingly. It is the seamless poised texture of this late harvest that stands out, along with supreme purity. Wait for this. Drink 2020—2035.",95,120.0
2613,Williams Selyem,"This winery always manages to pack in rich fruit and hearty spice. This bottling shows bay leaf, anise, pine needle and black tea aromas that accent a core of plum. That hearty dark fruit carries through to the palate as well, but warms up with earthy soil, licorice and minty fudge flavors. A luscious, lingering mouthful.",94,39.0
2614,Wines & Winemakers,"A blend of Touriga Nacional and Touriga Franca, this dark-colored, serious wine is concentrated and structured. It offers black fruits, giving a brooding character that's full of power. The aftertaste with its acidity and juicy fruit is elevated and leaves with a lift.",89,18.0
2615,Williams Selyem,"This wine has rich, almost sweet fruit aromas and vivid fruit flavors generously accented by clove, cinnamon and other spicy oak influences. The wine has full body, firm and supportive tannins and a lingering spiced-fruit finish. Best drink it after 2018 when the flavors will have married together.",92,58.0
2616,Fess Parker,"There's a feral quality to this single-vineyard bottling, with dried rose petals, damp pine needles, dehydrated shiitake mushrooms and touches of violet, potpourri and dried ginger on the nose. The mouthfeel is velvety, with lilac and lavender decorating a base of cranberry and boysenberry fruit.",92,50.0
2617,Bründlmayer,"Terrassen means a blend of wine from different vineyards. This crisp example is lively with acidity and green fruit flavors. It is very pure, bright and ready to drink. Screwcap.",88,25.0
2618,Albert Bichot,"Closed and firm, this wine has considerable structure, tannic and steely together. It's a forbidding wine at this stage, although it will develop much greater fruitiness and freshness as it ages. Under the structure, the wine has apple skin, hints of apricots and green pear flavors. The end brings in spice from the wood aging. Drink from 2019.",94,
2619,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Aromas of black fruit, spiced plum, vanilla and herb lead to full dark fruit flavors. It shows a lot of ripeness but keeps it in balance.",90,30.0
2620,Trapiche,"Saturated and pitch black to look at, and not much different in scent. This is a fully extracted, modern Bonarda that's well made and generous. Full-bodied wine lovers should like the meaty, dark berry and cocoa flavors. Tannic but layered on the finish.",89,15.0
2621,V. Sattui,"This lusty Zin shows the briary, brambly character of Dry Creek Valley that always makes its Zins taste a little rustic, which in no way detracts from its deliciousness. Dry and rich in tannins, it has long, deep flavors of spices, perfectly ripe summer berries and an herbal bitterness suggestive of chamomile tea and wild nettles. A better pizza wine cannot be imagined.",89,36.0
2622,Williams Selyem,"Dry, tart and balanced, it has keen acidity highlighting complex flavors of pomegranates, persimmons, cherries and sandalwood, with the earthy, plummy sweetness of mu shu sauce. This wine gets better and better as it breathes in the glass. It's hard to keep from opening it now, but it will benefit from aging; best after 2018.",95,75.0
2623,Williams Selyem,"The wine is always a blend of the winery's best vineyards in the northern, warm section of the valley, including Allen, Rochioli Riverblock and Williams Selyem's Estate. The 2012 is dry, tannic, delicately structured and mouthwateringly tart, with cranberry, raspberry, cherry, sandalwood and dried herb flavors. Enjoy it now and through 2018.",94,69.0
2624,Trapiche,"As far as Argentine Syrah goes, this vintage of Iscay, which contains 3% Viognier in a nod to France, is the new benchmark for the country. Daniel Pi and Joey Tensley's wine discloses aromas of jammy berry fruits along with cardamom and floral notes. The palate is a fortress of layers, while flavors of blackberry, cassis and chocolate set the stage for finishing notes of vanilla, butter, espresso and cocoa powder. Drink through 2018.",94,75.0
2625,Williams Selyem,"Williams  Selyem's track record with this bottling is excellent. While this 2012 has notes of raisins, they're more of a seasoning than the main ingredient. It's a robust, lusty wine, filled with blackberries, dark chocolate, anise and pepper, yet balanced. It will age through 2024.",94,55.0
2626,Albert Bichot,There is a touch of minerality in this wine as well as a dry edge and ripe red-fruit flavors that are already attractive. It should be aged at least three years.,88,
2627,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Part of a Limited Release series, this is quite dry despite the 12% alcohol. It's lightly spritzy and fragrant of honeysuckle and Jonagold apples. Fresh and lively, this demonstrates excellent balance.",88,22.0
2628,Columbia Crest,"This has been barrel-fermented and aged, yet it retains more than a hint of the grape's natural herbaceousness. Sharp-edged and assertive, it might pass for a Quincy from the Loire Valley.",88,20.0
2629,DFJ Vinhos,"This is a pale colored rosé, light and fruity. It has a touch of caramel to go with the ripe strawberry fruitiness. The finish is fresh and crisp. Drink now.",84,8.0
2630,Trapiche,"Earthy, woodsy, spicy aromas set up an electric, almost overcharged palate with no finesse. Bright cherry flavors turn peppery as the finish tastes blackened and bitter. Overly lively and unsettled.",83,18.0
2631,Casa Santos Lima,"This wine is soft and bland, just hinting at fruit and acidity. Drink now.",83,
2632,Williams Selyem,"This Port-style wine is rich, sweet and frankly a joy to drink. It has chocolate-covered raisin, blackberry and blueberry jam and sweet oak flavors, with refreshing acidity for balance.",90,40.0
2633,Kendall-Jackson,"Sticky tar, dense blackberry, leather, soy and lilacs combine for a thick nose on this well-priced, widely available bottling. Beef char, dense purple flowers, blackberry jam and tar consume the palate, which is chewy with a strong tannic structure.",87,17.0
2634,V. Sattui,"It's called Secco, according to the winery, because it's completely dry. Maybe so, but there's plenty of honeyed richness in this delightful Riesling. It shows a wealth of delicious, easy-drinking flavors of orange, apricot, Key lime pie and vanilla.",88,25.0
2635,Foxen,"This Cab shows how ripe the Happy Canyon area can get grapes even in a cool vintage. The wine brims with red cherry, currant and licorice flavors that are, in a word, delicious. It's adequate in acidity, but is a little candied. Drink now.",87,54.0
2636,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"As its name implies, this wine comes from chalk soil, giving both a strongly mineral character and ripe tropical fruit flavors. It's rich, full in the mouth, dry but with such a ripe character there seems to be some sweetness. It's impressively full and ready to drink now.",92,55.0
2637,Lynmar,"Honeysuckle and jasmine pique interest aromatically before luscious, linear waves of vanilla, caramel and lemon custard graciously interject, buoyed by ample acidity and a lush texture. This Chardonnay offers generous richness alongside high-toned minerality, and is a delicious go-to for buttery lobster dishes.",92,55.0
2638,Williams Selyem,"You can taste the California sun in every sip of this gorgeous Pinot Noir. It brims with luscious raspberries and cherries accented by brisk acidity and a hint of sweet, smoky oak. It's terrifically complex, with notes of mushroom, orange zest, cola, rosehip tea and persimmon. Dry and elegant, with a wonderful mouthfeel, it's gorgeous now, but will gain earthy complexity over the next 15 years.",96,82.0
2639,Williams Selyem,"One sip is all it takes to be blown away by this Pinot's beauty. It's exquisitely crafted, a testament to both the vineyard and the winery's oenological talent. The palate is bright and tangy with acidity, and incredibly complex flavors of wild berries, mushrooms, balsam, cola and Asian spices. It's dramatic now, but will continue to improve for at least 15 years.",95,75.0
2640,Casa Santos Lima,"This wine has a lively, open and fruity side that promises plenty of good barbecues. Red fruits and acidity lie easily together. Drink now.",86,10.0
2641,DFJ Vinhos,"This is a ripe wine with soft tannins and juicy black fruits. It has a good balance between the fruit and the structure, making it a wine for early, easy, beside-the-barbecue drinking.",86,10.0
2642,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,Nuits Saint-Georges is the home of the Aegerter family and its Domaine. This ripe spicy smoky wine is rich both from the vintage and from the core of tannins that are typical of the appellation. It is a smooth rounded wine although it will need some aging. Drink from 2020.,90,70.0
2643,Louis Jadot,"The acidity is most obvious at this stage of the wine's development. It does have structure, but it feels cool and tight. A green edge at the back adds to the cool character.",85,39.0
2644,Santa Ema,"Pure cherry and cassis aromas carry the bouquet to a juicy and tightly wound palate that bears cassis, chocolate and toast flavors. This hits the spot with a long, lightly herbal and solid finish. Drink now through 2015.",90,22.0
2645,Lynmar,"A blend of several vineyards, including Kanzler, Quail Hill and Umino, with some Freestone also in the bottle, this wine was given an almost 50% whole-cluster fermentation. Crisp cherry, strawberry and an inviting squeeze of citrus sit atop darker notes of cinnamon toast, the whole awash in a floral flourish of orange blossom.",94,70.0
2646,Lynmar,"This is the producer's first vintage from this vineyard—the grapes were previously sold. The site, which sits within Green Valley as well as the Sonoma Coast, is planted to the same clone as sister property Quail Hill, in coveted Goldridge soils. Soft, round and decadent, the wine is full bodied, with bursts of red fruit and crushed stone.",94,65.0
2647,Bründlmayer,"White pepper is already signalled on the nose, on the palate it keeps fizzing amid crushed herbs and yeasty, salty tanginess. The fruit for now remains in the background, but ripe pear is ready to burst forth. This is a quintessential Grüner, full of focus and direction without forgetting the all-important charm. Lovely now but will be even better after 2018.",94,60.0
2648,Lynmar,"A barrel-selection of Susanna's, this wine has grip and yet is also silky and elegant. Cranberry and plum star on the palate, bright and plush, the acidity tightly managed and brought to life. Medium bodied, this wine has depth and breadth, finishing in clove and cardamon-dusted orange peel.",93,65.0
2649,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Made with century-old, ungrafted vines, this structured red offers aromas of mature black plum, dark spice, tobacco and a whiff of blue flower. The generous, enveloping palate doles out layers of juicy black cherry, blackberry, anise, cinnamon and clove framed in densely packed but ripe tannins. Give it time to unwind and fully develop. Drink after 2020–2030.",93,75.0
2650,Kendall-Jackson,"This full-bodied wine combines spicy aromas with deep fruit flavors like plum and blackberry. The fresh, juicy texture has just enough tannin to make it appetizing. The wine has enough heft to pair well with a lot of savory and meaty dishes.",89,17.0
2651,Fess Parker,"Plump red cherry and star anise aromas meet sagebrush and rust on the nose of this appellation blend. It's light bodied on the palate, where tangy acidity presents cranberry, mace and dried meat flavors.",88,30.0
2652,Concha y Toro,"Earthy and dark to start, with blackberry, cassis, mineral and leather on the nose. Feels rich and slightly syrupy, with herb, sweet berry and brown sugar flavors. Impressive for its power and density; finishes smooth, with mild tannins and caramel flavors. Drink now through 2015.",91,38.0
2653,Robert Mondavi,"Textbook Napa Cab. It's dry, smoothly tannic and subtle, with blackberry, cassis and dark chocolate flavors nicely intrigued with herbs, tobacco and cedar. Just delicious now and for the next few years.",91,28.0
2654,Bründlmayer,"Subtle pepper and undergrowth notes play as strongly of a role as the gentle red currant fruit in this understated, lighter-bodied but spicy wine. Made in a very traditional vein, it is an unobtrusive, versatile red for lighter lunches where its pepperiness will score extra points.",88,
2655,Foxen,"There's no oak on this Chardonnay, but you won't miss it at all. It's so decadent in long hangtime pineapple, tangerine, mango and spice flavors, superripe and just delicious. The alcohol is fairly high, but that's the price of all this richness.",92,32.0
2656,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"Rich and soft, it offers a ripe cushion of Chardonnay and a warm, rounded personality. While it misses out on a more structured character, the yellow fruits and light spice from wood aging give immediate drinkability.",86,56.0
2657,DFJ Vinhos,"This is a powerfully structured wine, not heavy but firm, with tannins and tensile acidity. The dry core of the wine supports blueberry and violet flavors concentrated on the palate. Drink from 2017.",91,20.0
2658,Foxen,"Quite light in color, this energetic blend of 76% Grenache and 24% Mourvèdre offers cinnamon stick, star anise, cola, raspberry and strawberry on the juicy and bright nose. The palate shows a lighter but juicy cranberry-fruit profile, with fennel, coriander and white pepper. It's a great, lighter style of red wine.",91,40.0
2659,Undurraga,"Fresh, almost minerally berry aromas avoid any sense of weight, oak or heaviness. The blend of Garnacha, Carignan and Mourvèdre is uncommon in Chile, and it comes across with a sinewy, fresh mouthfeel and lightly herbal flavors of plum and cassis along with modest oak. Spice, tobacco, coffee and chocolate flavors carry the finish on this complex Maule Valley blend. Drink through 2020.",91,35.0
2660,Robert Mondavi,"Salted caramel, brine, herb and lemongrass combine for a complexity of flavors and textures in this consistently great white. A sizzling vein of minerality on the palate balances the heartiness of the wood. Lemon pith features on the lengthy finish.",91,40.0
2661,Maryhill,"There is an unusual sensation of spritz in the mouth, though no hint of any CO2 can be seen in the glass. This is bone dry, stemmy and earthy, with the most prominent flavor.",85,25.0
2662,Maryhill,"Light raspberry, sweet cracker and barrel flavors are all present. It's a Cabernet with more charm than muscle.",85,36.0
2663,Maryhill,"This simple Cabernet Sauvignon is lightly fruity and forward, with berry flavors that seem to fade on the midpalate. It resolves in a wash of drying, herbal tannins.",85,30.0
2664,Siduri,"Winemakers fight to get fruit from this coveted vineyard, which famously produces ageworthy Pinots. Siduri's 2012 vintage is surprisingly versatile with lovely raspberry, cherry and cocoa flavors, accented with sweet oak. The balance is impeccable, with fine acidity and soft, refined tannins. You can certainly enjoy it now, but it should also develop well through 2018.",92,52.0
2665,DFJ Vinhos,"The Arinto is right at home in the Lisboa region, giving its best in the cool ocean climate. It is light and bright, fruity with citrus flavors and perfect with summer seafood. Drink now.",85,9.0
2666,DFJ Vinhos,"This blend of the rare Caladoc with Tinta Roriz has plenty of the red-berry fruitiness and cool acidity typical of a wine from the ocean-influenced Lisboa region. The tannins are soft; the fruit is up front, with just with a touch of spice.",85,10.0
2667,Wines & Winemakers,"Intense and crisp, it shows bright fruits and some weight as well. A touch of yellow fruits give the grapefruit a warmer character and good depth of flavor. It's a Vinho Verde for cooler days, ripe and ready for food.",90,18.0
2668,Chehalem,"This is a rarely made super-reserve from the 30-year-old Ridgecrest vineyard. It echoes the other 2011 reserve bottling from Chehalem, with extra concentration and grip. The fruit flavors run to raspberry and cherry, and the wine is balanced and crisply defined.",90,99.0
2669,Wines & Winemakers,"A smooth, rich wine whose fruit is ripe, full of blackberry flavors and perfumed acidity. It also has weight, concentration and a tight mineral edge that gives it extra complexity. The wine is fruity and ready to drink.",90,18.0
2670,Trapiche,"This high-class blend of Malbec and Cabernet Franc is both elegant and powerful. The bouquet deals classic Malbec aromas of cola, licorice and blackberry, while the palate features typical Cabernet Franc spice, along with a ripe, healthy blackberry flavor. Expansive and buttery smooth on the finish, this should be opened now–2016.",92,50.0
2671,Foxen,"A mind-bending array of aromas come to play in this bottling by Winemaker Billy Wathen, with savory tones of crushed pepper, teriyaki, fresh but underripe berry fruit, piquant forest underbrush, wet chaparral and raw lamb gaminess. It's surprisingly light and lithe on the lovely palate, with black peppercorn, thyme, lavender and complex beef-stew notes.",94,46.0
2672,Gary Farrell,"This excellent vineyard-designated wine showcases salty brine and explosive minerality. It's light and bright on the nose but fleshy in lemon, lime and peach, with a zesty quality to the texture. Integrated oak, only 40% of it new, plays a background role, allowing for a soft, lengthy palate and a structure that suggests this will age well.",94,50.0
2673,Testarossa,"Wet slate minerality leads the brisk, tightly wound nose. On the palate, the wine is a bit perfumed, at least for how tight the nose is, with elements of crisp apple, pear and a touch of nectarine.",87,45.0
2674,Kunde,"For all the richness, and there's plenty of it in the pineapple, Meyer lemondrop and vanilla notes, this Chard has a gunmetal minerality that grounds it. The “Nu” designation indicates that it's unoaked.",87,18.0
2675,Kendall-Jackson,"Made in the familiar style that is K-J Vintner's Reserve, this Chardonnay shows pineapple, lemondrop, mineral and spice flavors balanced with crisp coastal acidity.",87,12.0
2676,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"The subtle, rounded but rather aromatic perfume of peach skins and apricot compote on the nose is utterly seductive—there is a promise of oriental riches and exotic spice but above all pure, glowing peach fruit. The palate is in total focus: while some residual sugar illuminates every last vestige of fruit, there is guiding central force that never lets this slip into the merely opulent. A masterful tightrope walk amidst plump fruit and mineral precision with a finishing, pleasantly bitter edge of marzipan.",95,120.0
2677,Robert Mondavi,"Smells and tastes a bit weedy or stalky, with slightly green blackberry and cherry flavors. The absence of fruit accentuates the tannins, making them feel harder than they really are. Drink now.",86,28.0
2678,Kunde,"More useful than rich, this Cab is dry and full-bodied, with blackberry, black currant, herb and smoky oak flavors. Drink now.",86,22.0
2679,Chanson Père et Fils,"A rounded wine, this is a blend of different premier-cru vineyards in Beaune. It packed with raspberries and red cherries. The acidity, typical of the year, is restrained here by the ripe fruitiness. Tannins give the wine just the right amount of support.",91,59.0
2680,Chanson Père et Fils,"This wine is tight, nervy and crisp, with a strongly mineral texture. There is good acidity, crisp and textured. Apples and citrus dominate this structured wine. Drink from 2019.",91,53.0
2681,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"Rich and aromatic notes of fresh and baked red apples perfume nose and palate. They appear with equal expression on the juicy, soft but defined palate. This is full fruited and textured, ringing with soy spice and lemony freshness. The savoriness of the midpalate echoes long after the last drop.",91,21.0
2682,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Dried yellow flower, yellow stone fruit and a whiff of acacia honey meld together in the glass. The vibrant, linear palate includes lemon zest, lime, pineapple, dried herb and flinty mineral framed in tangy acidity. A note of wild fennel closes the finish. Hold for even more complexity. Drink through 2024.",91,60.0
2683,V. Sattui,"Voluptuously full-bodied and smoky, this 100% varietal wine imparts characteristics of cedar, herb and cigar on its grippy and generous palate. This is a reserve-level wine that delivers on that promise, it finishes awash in fists of black pepper.",91,45.0
2684,Albert Bichot,"With structure and some firm tannins, this wine is on the dry side. It has black fruits that will develop over time, and certainly show now with a juicy background. The acidity is refreshing even through the solid tannins. Drink from 2020.",91,80.0
2685,Chehalem,"A feminine, almost soft Pinot Noir, this opens nicely with scents of roses, red fruits, and pine forest. Despite its light color, it has plenty of grip and density in the mouth, even bringing some streaks of light milk chocolate into the finish.",89,32.0
2686,Kendall-Jackson,"A nice, lush and tart Pinot whose dryness comes as a welcome surprise, given the massive fruit. Cherries, raspberries, currants, cola and smoky cedar flood the mouth, yet the finish is crisp and balanced. With its silky texture, this “deep end” wine is best now and for a few years.",89,30.0
2687,Kendall-Jackson,"Lots of exotic tropical papayas and guavas in this soft, honeyed Chard. It's rich and creamy, yet shows enough acidity to lend it balance. Great to drink with lobster, crab, scallops.",89,25.0
2688,Concha y Toro,"Jammy raspberry and plum aromas are primary and fresh on the nose. This ripe, round wine is sure to be a party-pleaser. Solid cassis, berry and spice flavors finish pure, with ripeness and proper balance.",89,18.0
2689,Casa Santos Lima,"Big, bold and fruity, this dense wine has rich, red berry fruits and firm tannins its the core. While ripe and fruity, there is a hint of salty sea spray from a cool maritime influence. Drink now.",89,10.0
2690,Columbia Crest,"Nearly 100% Merlot with just a pinch of Cabernet Sauvignon blended in, it brings an assortment of red fruit notes along with plum, milk chocolate and coffee. The barrel flavors play a big part in the show with the tannins giving a lightly chalky feel.",89,15.0
2691,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"Vines planted between 900 and 1,200 feet above sea level give this cool interpretation of Pinot Noir. The wine is crisp, lightly structured with some tannins and with a delicate cherry and red-berry fruitiness. It will be ready to drink from 2017.",87,33.0
2692,Louis Latour,"From vineyards at the south end of the Côte de Nuits, this is a fruity, crisp wine with attractive ready-to-drink fruit flavors. The aftertaste is tight and packed with acidity.",87,38.0
2693,Louis Latour,"With some tannins and with bright red fruits, this wine is structured and has attractive acidity. A perfumed wine with a fruity future, it will be ready to drink from 2018.",87,26.0
2694,Chehalem,"An exemplary rendition of the RR reserve bottling, this vintage is loaded with honey and spice. Smooth, off-dry, complex and full bodied, it's in perfect balance between sweetness and tang, mixing fruit and skin components with that succulence. Lively and energetic, it's delicious now but will benefit from age. Drink through 2030.",93,39.0
2695,Kendall-Jackson,"This Syrah is so good, it's crazy to think K-J made 16,000 cases of it and is selling it at this price. It's dry, tannic and full-bodied, just what you want in a steak-friendly wine, and the amazing flavors range from blackberry and cherry jam through cassis and plums to toast, smoked meat, vanilla, black pepper and dark chocolate.",91,17.0
2696,DFJ Vinhos,"This wine is so soft, gently fruity and easy to drink, but without much character or freshness. It's a gentle ramble that takes no effort.",83,7.0
2697,Robert Mondavi,"Over the years Mondavi's Reserve has taken a turn toward Chablis. Fans of lush, superripe Chards will find it tart, but it's really balanced and elegant. With a dry tang of minerals, it shows bright Meyer lemon, lime, pineapple and white peach flavors. One-third new oak adds creamy, smoky vanilla complexities. Should develop over the next six years.",93,40.0
2698,Williams Selyem,"Cloudy and exuberant in saltwater taffy, this wine is crisp and vivid in lemon, tangerine and vanilla. The oak is well behaved and game to provide structure without obstruction. Pear and apple give it weight and body with a stony minerality playfully drawn on the finish.",93,58.0
2699,Williams Selyem,"The mighty Hirsch rises to the occasion of a burly, near-perfect vintage, showing off its ability to be brawny and brainy at the same time. Black fruit, tar and tea take center stage, with an intensely tannic underbelly specked in wild herb and smoke. This baby needs time. Drink now after decanting or cellar through 2023.",93,78.0
2700,Fess Parker,"A rugged and feral quality marks the nose of this excellent wine. Black raspberry and plum aromas are laid across savory beef fat, dried sage and scents of mint, pencil lead and Indian spice. The mouthfeel is soft and the palate is meaty, with baked plum, black cherry, black cardamom and raw beef flavors, lifted by a minty quality.",93,55.0
2701,Testarossa,"This wine from a historic vineyard is hard to put down. It combines flint, pencil lead, smoked wood, chopped chives, sweet onion, crushed limestone and a touch of white pepper on the stonefruit-based nose. A strong toast and brioche character carries the sip, touching on white sesame, graphite and even shaved parmesan. It's savory, tangy and addictive.",94,48.0
2702,Siduri,"Adam Lee's bottling from one of the region's most famous vineyards is a winner for fans of the rich style of Pinot, lush with blackberry jam, lilac, cinnamon and gingerbread. The palate is similarly dense, soft and sultry, with tart olallieberry jam and plum jelly, but also lively with thyme, spearmint and a unique lemon verbena kick.",94,65.0
2703,Siduri,"Adam Lee makes some concentrated wines each vintage, and this one shows cherry syrup, sandalwood and some smoke on the dense, layered nose. The palate is similarly deep, rich and complex, with tangy cherry, mulberry, dried ginger and mace flavoring, rising into a chorus of camphor on the finish.",94,58.0
2704,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,Notes of burnt caramel hover above the glass but on the palate precision reigns. A frame of earthiness and zest still shrouds the fruit. This wine will take time to open up but has a promising core of concentrated flavor and a backbone around which layered flavors of pear and quince will express themselves. The earthy pear and citrus zest notes are full of promise. Drink 2018–2030.,94,80.0
2705,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"Appetizing notes of ripe Cox Orange Pippin apples, both in their fresh, crunchy state and in a more mellow baked version, characterize the flavors of this wine, with overtones of strawberry and sun-warmed stone. The juicy palate is concentrated and incredibly mouthwatering, with generous ripeness pitched against pure, zesty freshness. It offers concentration, liveliness and purity in one amazing package. Drink now until 2030 at least.",94,80.0
2706,Concha y Toro,"A little rough all the way along, with olive, black cherry and blackberry aromas yielding to mildly tart berry flavors. Acidity is jumpy and twangy, making the wine a little hot and streaky. But that intensity will serve it well if you're drinking it with a burger or skirt steak. Imported by Excelsior Wine & Spirits.",84,10.0
2707,Maryhill,"Light aromas of flower, apple, melon and pear lead to dry stone-fruit flavors. It's a pleasant if somewhat innocuous easy drinker.",85,19.0
2708,Wines & Winemakers,"This local grape, only found in the Douro, gives a crisp, green and citrus flavored wine. It is tight, tangy and full of acidity with an orange zest aftertaste. The wine is all fruit, ready to drink now.",88,18.0
2709,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"Situated in the center of the premier crus of Puligny, Champgains produces an elegant, textured wine. This bottling, with the warmth of 2013 behind it, is fragrant with white fruits and has a soft aftertaste. It needs to age to bring it out its more complex character, so wait until 2018.",90,141.0
2710,Casa Santos Lima,"Produced from vines grown in a boulder and fossil strewn vineyard, this is a rich smoky wine. It has a deep color from the Alicante Bouschet in the blend, with firm tannins and dark juicy plum skin flavors. It's going to be a ripe rich wine as it develops. Drink from 2017.",90,13.0
2711,DFJ Vinhos,"Intense perfumes give this fine apéritif wine an exotic character. Its crisp texture balances this, showcasing fine lime and grapefruit flavors as well as a touch of lychee. The acidity at the end is lively and refreshing. Drink now.",88,12.0
2712,V. Sattui,"The Preston Vineyard sits near the original site of Niebaum's original plantings for Inglenook, and also near the vineyards of Beaulieu Vineyards. Thick and rich in blackberry and espresso, this wine exudes its proximity to vigorous, big-boned sites, yet retains the elegance and herbal-cedar notes of the vintage, dusted in peppery spice.",90,95.0
2713,Undurraga,"Scratchy plum and spice aromas are entirely typical for coastal Chile. This wine feels racy and a bit high in acidity, while flavors of orange peel, pie cherry, red plum and mild oak end with juicy length and an indication that this is a quality wine, especially by Chilean Pinot Noir standards.",89,25.0
2714,Williams Selyem,"So rich and powerful in fruit. Blackberry and cherry jam, mocha, cola, tobacco, black pepper, anise, licorice, beef jerky, it's all there, on steroids.",89,50.0
2715,Concha y Toro,"Nice and aromatic, with cola, tobacco, fallen dried leaves and dark fruits. The palate has some scratch and acidity to it, but the flavors are good and lively, with a focus on dark plum and cherry. A bit more acidic than I like, but still healthy and very nice for varietal Carmenère.",88,22.0
2716,Columbia Crest,"A blend of 60% Syrah, 27% Merlot and a handful of other varieties added to the mix, this aromatically pops, with complex notes of plum, blueberry, smoke, chocolate and floral accents. It's silky smooth in feel, with abundant chocolaty flavors that help it go down far too easy.",91,15.0
2717,Fess Parker,"This proprietary blend starts with a very gamy though thoroughly enjoyable nose of charred meat, coffee, berry and compost. On the palate, there is espresso, dried herbs and black cherry, proving to be a complex and savory yet very easy-to-like wine.",91,35.0
2718,Testarossa,"Earthy aromas of rust, loam and dark red plum meet with scents of charred oak on the nose of this bottling. There is a bright acidity to the sip, but it surrounds a darker core of cran-raspberry fruit, with peppery spice and well-integrated rosewater flavors showing toward the finish.",91,65.0
2719,Undurraga,"Tight-grained oak, vanilla, graphite, plum and cassis aromas are attractive as a whole. This feels good but a bit tartaric and scratchy. Ripe black-fruit flavors are pure Peumo, while touches of licorice and chocolate add to the fun. A saturated finish tastes of blackberry, black currant and peppery spice. Drink through 2022.",91,25.0
2720,Georges Duboeuf,"Soft and round, this has a gentle white fruit flavor and a hint of spice. The acidity is open and very easy, finishing with a fragrant finish.",84,
2721,Georges Duboeuf,"With a light structure and some minerality, this is an attractive, textured wine. Flavors of apples, citrus fruits and a note of caramel pair with its zesty character that lends an attractive finishing bite.",84,13.0
2722,DFJ Vinhos,"Cool climate Alicante Bouschet from the Lisboa region has a strongly perfumed character as well as intense fruitiness. The structure, while offering firm tannins, is balanced with the acidity that gives a crisp aftertaste. It all makes for a firm wine with a chance to age. Drink from late 2018.",89,15.0
2723,Montes,"On first take, this hefty Carmenère smells almost entirely of massive oak and related vanilla and maple, although airing calms things down. A dense, heavily oaked palate is extracted and full in body. Charred oak and coffee flavors cover blackberry and cassis notes, while this is flush on a huge finish.",89,23.0
2724,Trapiche,"With floral aromas, toasty oak notes and solid berry fruit, this bottling is the best among Trapiche's 2007 single-vineyard Malbecs. The palate features smoky berry fruit but also high acidity and some scour. Fortunately it's also layered and structured. Will do best with meats and fatty foods. Drink now through 2015.",90,50.0
2725,Trapiche,"Potent smelling, with black pepper, lots of oak and true berry fruit aromas. The palate is a bit pointed and high in acidity, while the flavors of raspberry, currants and red plum are solid. Finishes a little jagged and acidic, but at worst that staunch acidity will keep it alive for years to come. Hold until at least 2011.",89,50.0
2726,Williams Selyem,"So rich and powerful in fruit. Blackberry and cherry jam, mocha, cola, tobacco, black pepper, anise, licorice, beef jerky, it's all there, on steroids.",89,50.0
2727,Fess Parker,"This clonal study explores the earthy side of the grape, with mulberry and dark cranberry fruit running alongside damp oak forest and slightly funky chaparral aromas. Lively flavors consume the palate quickly with tart cherry and peppery spice, all lifted by mouthwatering acidity.",91,58.0
2728,Fess Parker,"This refreshing and crisply designed Viognier conveys restrained aromas of white peach and vanilla. The palate shows yellow melon and creamy peach, but with a razor-sharp edge of acidity and a compelling chalky texture. The acid sizzles into the finish.",91,28.0
2729,Santa Ema,"Cherry aromas are dilute, and overall the bouquet on this Leyda Pinot Noir is limited. Tart, hard, medicinal red-berry flavors are nondistinct and oaky. The finish is raw, hot and lacking in fruit.",82,15.0
2730,Gary Farrell,"To tame Durell is no easy feat—indeed at first this wine exudes matchstick and robustness on the nose and palate. But tameness comes in the form of lemon and grapefruit pith, brightening the load, with a sinewy structure supporting its core. The finish is succulent in honey and stone. Drink now through 2020.",96,55.0
2731,Louis Jadot,"This rich, wood-fermented and aged wine is very ripe, aromatic and smoothly textured. The terroir reveals itself in a mineral edge from the chalk soil that also comes into play in the tight acidity. Full in the mouth, it's ready to drink now, but will be better from 2016.",89,28.0
2732,Concha y Toro,"Aromas of bland citrus, oyster shell and pool water are not stout or convincing. This basic SB feels flat, while flavors of bell pepper and salted pickle finish light, bland and green.",83,11.0
2733,Georges Duboeuf,"The cru wine is tight, missing out on what should be its fruitiness. It has some tough dry tannins that are not showing signs of softening.",83,22.0
2734,Undurraga,"A hard-driving, ultragreen nose oozes pure bell pepper. A plump palate with cutting lime-like acidity adds zest and sharpness to vegetal citrus flavors. Packed to the brim with pyrazines, this is about as green as SB gets.",83,22.0
2735,DFJ Vinhos,A selection of old vines has given an intensely structured wine. It is packed both with tannins and concentrated black fruits. The density of the ripe fruits show how well the wine is maturing. Drink from 2017.,91,50.0
2736,Casa Santos Lima,"The southern coastal region of Algarve is better known for beaches than for wine. This blend of Touriga Nacional and Syrah with long wood aging comes from the east of the region and shows great warmth as well as black plum fruit flavors. The juicy fruitiness is balanced by the youthful structure, showing the aging potential of the wine. Drink from 2017.",90,35.0
2737,Albert Bichot,"Attractive, ripe and fruity, this has a light citrus texture and full-throated acidity. Apples, bright fruit and a ripe mouthfeel give it a ready-to-drink character.",87,
2738,Kunde,"Too oaky, with vanilla, smoky toothpick influences leading to sweet-and-sour pineapple flavors. This problem has plagued Kunde's reserve Chard for the last several vintages.",84,35.0
2739,Maryhill,"As is most often the case with Sangiovese, this comes across as a pleasant, rather generic red wine that could be almost anything. The fruit tastes of light cherry and plum, with a rather sour finish. Tannins are earthy and there is a hint of sweaty saddle as well.",83,32.0
2740,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"This wine's ripe, mineral texture balances its yellow and white stone fruit flavors. It has a toasty, caramel character, giving extra richness. Drink from late 2017.",88,19.0
2741,Concha y Toro,"Popcorn, mustard, pickle brine and a heavy blast of oak create a barrel-driven bouquet. This is acidic and juicy on the palate, but also resiny. Flavors of briny citrus, nectarine and raw oak finish long and woody, with a cidery aftertaste.",86,50.0
2742,Columbia Crest,"Half of this wine is Merlot, with the rest Cabernet Franc, Malbec, Petit Verdot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah. Blueberry, coffee and vanilla aromas are followed by sultry plum flavors speckled with barrel accents before a mocha-flavored finish.",88,12.0
2743,Wines & Winemakers,"Light, fruity and off dry, this is a fresh and crisp wine. It has sweetened lemon juice flavors that are cut by intense, young acidity. Balanced and ready to drink now.",85,10.0
2744,Casa Santos Lima,"Solid tannins, juicy fruits and considerable acidity dominate this wine. It has a fresh character—dry at the back while showing some potential for aging. Spice and final refreshing acidity complete the picture. Drink from 2016.",85,
2745,Casa Santos Lima,"This is a soft, fresh and fruity wine. It has red berry flavors that are gently lifted by fine tannins. Acidity and a juicy aftertaste complete an attractive, ready-to-drink wine.",85,
2746,Chanson Père et Fils,"This wine offers fresh lemon and a lightly creamy fruitiness. It is floral in character with attractive acidity. Fruity, with a crisp citrus tang at the end, it is ready to drink.",85,24.0
2747,Trapiche,"Dry oak, pepper and wood resin are prominent on the bouquet, which also brings minty black fruit scents and finally a pinch of sawdust. The palate is boosted by firm acids and tannins, while the flavors of baked berry and black plum are driving. A lot of oak and bite here, but also plenty of dark fruit.",87,15.0
2748,Trapiche,"Smoky and leathery on the nose, with earthy blackberry aromas, tobacco and tree bark aromas. The palate runs sort of heavy, tannic and raw, with grapey flavors of black currant and roasted plum. A chunky, earthy, roasted style of Cab to drink now.",87,15.0
2749,DFJ Vinhos,"A wine that emphasizes the black currant acidity and firm tannins of Cabernet Sauvignon. The fruit layers acidity, wood and some herbs. Age for another year.",87,10.0
2750,Fess Parker,"There's a wild array of aromas to this appellation blend, including wild mint and huckleberries. It's bright red fruit at first sip, then the wine downshifts into cloves, wet asphalt and anise. A direct but clean and very appealing selection, ready for enjoyment now.",91,30.0
2751,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"While there are still plenty of firm tannins, the wine also is now showing its red berry fruits and enticing texture. Great acidity cuts through the structure, giving freshness to the naturally dense character of this Grand Cru wine. It's for aging, but not for too long, so drink from 2017.",91,184.0
2752,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"Well structured, this combines ripe red fruits with a firm texture. It has a good concentration and a mineral, terroir-driven character that shows through in its dry core. The juicy acidity at the end gives a lift, but the wine needs to age. Drink from 2017.",91,74.0
2753,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"Every Burgundy merchant seems to have a Clos de Vougeot. The Aegerter's version is relatively light, as much fruit as tannins even while it is young. Berry fruits comes forward, while the layer of tannin is in a supporting role. It's a solid wine, not one that has a long future. Drink from 2018.",91,369.0
2754,Lynmar,"Block 10 was made with 25% whole cluster fermentation, the result bold and impressive in cola cherry and soft baking spices, an intriguing floral note akin to geranium or gardenia highlighting the palate. Midway, expect an expansive opening of the wine, before notes of cocoa and espresso delve in.",91,70.0
2755,Georges Duboeuf,"Georges Duboeuf follows this cru estate, owned by the Meziat family, and produces the wine. It is a ripe wine, shot through with young, juicy acidity. There is structure as well as minerality to give the wine shape. Drink from late 2017.",89,19.0
2756,Undurraga,"Uncomplicated berry and plum aromas are easy to process. This everyday Cabernet feels complete despite showing rubbery grabby tannins. Lightly herbal plum and berry flavors finish tight, bright and fresh.",89,18.0
2757,Bründlmayer,"This wine has concentration, but it also demonstrates great elegance in its crisp acidity, lemon-zest-like texture and bright fruitiness. It's a wine to age for several years, but it can also be consumed soon.",92,55.0
2758,Chehalem,"A special, 25th anniversary bottling, this is a knockout. Dark, smoky and tannic, this has a deep, black fruit flavor, threaded with rich streaks of licorice, coffee and chocolate. Further detail comes in the form of peppery herb. This is thick, muscular and integrated.",92,69.0
2759,Concha y Toro,"This iconic Chilean Cabernet is firm on the nose, with cola, cassis, cherry and leather aromas. It's racy, juicy and powerful, with flavors of cassis, blackberry, plum, nutmeg and coffee that swim in harmony. This is big, but also elegant and clean. Drink through 2019.",92,95.0
2760,Siduri,"Very big, very rich, almost a fruit store in itself. Offers a wild ride of intensely ripe, extracted cherries, currants, blackberries and blueberries that taste like jam spread on buttery toast, then sprinkled with cinnamon and cocoa. Also fairly tannic and full-bodied. Lacks some delicacy, but delicious and dramatic.",91,49.0
2761,Siduri,"Siduri has a good track record with this vineyard. The ‘07 is not a longterm ager, but if you're looking for a complex Russian River Pinot for now and through 2011, this will please. Dry and silky and complex, it has fully ripened cherry, currant, cola, rose petal and spice flavors.",91,44.0
2762,Williams Selyem,"Showing impeccable elegance, this is totally dry and tart in acidity, with a quietly tannic astringency that suggests pairing with lamb or steak. While it's not an ager, the cola, pomegranate, cherry and mushroom flavors are classic and complex.",92,52.0
2763,Fess Parker,"Blended with its Rhône cousins, Marsanne and Grenache Blanc, this is a very rich, soft white wine. It's flamboyant in orange, apricot, peach, buttered toast and vanilla custard flavors that finish sweet. Could be drier and better structured.",86,24.0
2764,Gary Farrell,"Very ripe, sweet and oaky, tasting almost like a dessert wine, or at least a melted cherry and plum pastry. Delicious in an obvious way, but lacks complexity, and doesn't seem like an ager. Drink up.",86,50.0
2765,Gary Farrell,"This structured rosé packs a punch in tannins at first, but is balanced and dry. Refreshing bursts of wild berries and savory herb lead to a smooth and exotic finish. The subtle power reflects the vintage and Green Valley-sourced vineyards.",89,28.0
2766,Wines & Winemakers,"This richly structured wine comes from the the state-owned Companhia das Lezirias, the largest estate in Portugal. With equestrian events, wine, olive oil and an ecological sanctuary just east of Lisbon, the property merits a visit. Named for the barn owl that nests in estate forests, the wine is opulent, dense and packed with tannins and ripe black fruits. Give it time, at least until late 2018.",93,30.0
2767,Montes,"After a dark, earthy, leathery opening, this blend of Carignan, Grenache and Mourvèdre presents itself as a lively, bright wine with dark fruit flavors, leather, dry spice, oak and a touch of heat on the finish. This is a serious blend with a chewy body and no shortage of power. Drink now–2017.",90,60.0
2768,Trapiche,"Fairly large, dark and extracted, but also lush and rich, with aromas of raisin and stewed blackberry. The palate is rich to the point of almost being heavy, while the flavors of blackberry and roasted black plum are mildly leathery and salty. Nice, big, meaty and tasty for the price.",88,12.0
2769,Testarossa,"A little gritty in texture, and the rawness is compounded by black pepper tartness. Yet there's a huge, succulent core of black cherry fruit, and the wine is perfectly dry and acidic. An interesting Pinot, one to stash in the cellar and see what happens.",88,56.0
2770,V. Sattui,"Here's a sweet dessert wine that's a pleasure to drink after a meal, with little fruit-based filo pastries. Made in the traditional solera style, the wine is rich in raspberry cream, chocolate and cherry liqueur flavors, and finishes clean and spicy.",88,42.0
2771,V. Sattui,"The winery pulled out all the stops on this Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend, yet the wine is so tannic and sharp now. Shows massively extracted black currant and oak flavors that run deep and long in the finish. Who knows what this wine might do in 10–15 years, but it's a roll of the dice.",91,75.0
2772,Gary Farrell,"A big, strong Chardonnay, powerfully extracted with pineapple and orange jam flavors, with lots of zingy acidity that makes the mouth water. There's a touch of buttered toast from oak. A little brittle and hard now, so give it two to three years in the bottle to soften and mellow.",90,35.0
2773,V. Sattui,"There's a rich vein of green olives in this wine, alongside the blackberries, cocoa and toast. With smooth, brisk tannins, it's best opened over the next 2–3 years.",90,35.0
2774,Louis Latour,"With its mineral character, freshness and tight, taut structure, this is a promising wine, flavors of green fruits giving some richness but more crispness.",89,
2775,Louis Latour,"Weighty yes, and with a full-on richness, but also touched with a surprising amount of minerality. The flavors range from the almost tropical to apple-fresh acidity. It's full, but certainly balanced by its acidity.",89,
2776,Maryhill,"Aromas of fresh raspberries, plum and spice provide intrigue, with some reductive notes providing a bit of distraction. The plum and spice flavors are broad in feel, needing more acidity to tighten them up.",87,26.0
2777,Louis Latour,"This wine is soft and round, with attractive acidity as well as a light sense of structure from tannins. It features considerable acidity along with wild strawberry flavors that keep it lifted and aromatic. Drink from 2017.",91,90.0
2778,Robert Mondavi,"With a soft, heavy mouthfeel and hot, candied raspberry and cherry flavors, this Reserve Pinot is a disappointment. It's okay, but tastes like a simple little Pinot Noir for drinking now.",86,60.0
2779,Santa Ema,"Sweet as sin on the nose, with a ton of barrel-driven spice, resin and vanilla. The palate is full, creamy and resiny in feel, with more oak than anything on the flavor profile. There's baked apple and spice too, while the finish is severely oaky.",86,24.0
2780,Concha y Toro,"Crisp plum and berry aromas are a little sharp while the oak element on the nose is drying. The palate is tight and fairly high in acidity, yielding herbal, minty flavors of raspberry and red plum. Short and solid on the finish, but clean and good overall.",86,12.0
2781,Kunde,"Dry and layered in crisp melon, lime and lemon zest, this aromatic SB is complex and kissed by honeysuckle. It's a natural go-to for shellfish, especially Hog Island oysters from the coast near Point Reyes. A warm goat cheese salad would also do nicely.",89,17.0
2782,Iron Horse,"Iron Horse's estate Chard is a remarkably consistent wine. Never overoaked, superripe or heavy, it always has an elegant minerality. The '06, from a coolish vintage, is flavored with green apples, Meyer lemons and Bosc pears.",91,28.0
2783,Williams Selyem,"This bottling from esteemed producer Williams Selyem is a rich, concentrated wine, brimming with savory flavors of wild cherries and raspberries, red currants, milk chocolate, cloves and black pepper. The extraordinary tannins are smooth and as fine as velvet.",91,48.0
2784,Testarossa,"Hearty and thick aromas of raspberry, mulberry and sugar plums meet with a touch of bay leaf on the nose of this bottling from a famous vineyard. Woody and dark red fruits show on the sip, with juniper and sour cherry flavors most prominent.",91,65.0
2785,Iron Horse,"Drier and leaner than the 2005, this is a fancy Chardonnay marked by crisp structure and minerality, rather than extreme lushness. Yet you'll find an overlay of toasty oak and fine flavors of green apples and pineapples that satisfy the fruit tooth. The alcohol is under 14%, and the finish is totally dry.",90,45.0
2786,Fess Parker,"There's a palate-warming generosity to this single-vineyard Pinot, a result of its softly balanced texture and the smoothness of new oak. Luxurious flavors of smoky cherries and currants, roasted nuts, molasses and honey taste almost like an energy fruit bar from the health food store. This lovely, supple wine should develop through 2012.",90,58.0
2787,Maryhill,"Though Washington is rarely recognized for its Gewürztraminers, the grape does exceptionally well here, and Celilo in particular has become a treasured hunting ground for winemakers specializing in the grape. This one is a gem: spicy and off-dry, it expands across the palate with authority and precision. Rather than sweetly floral, it leans toward flavors that are sweetly grassy, but lets pretty rose petal highlights fill in the back of the palate.",89,14.0
2788,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"The hot climate of the Cold Creek Vineyard sharpens up the contours of this Chardonnay, which shows more of a classic Washington character. Bright fruit, a mix of apples and peaches and pears, is shot through with streaks of butterscotch from fermentation in new French oak. It's been through 100% malolactic, yet retains some crispness. Polished and full-bodied.",89,20.0
2789,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Raspberry, cocoa, coffee and vanilla aromas lead to plump, focused fruit flavors. It's both appealing and quite varietally correct. For those looking for a quality value Merlot, look no further.",89,15.0
2790,Columbia Crest,"Aromas of plum and blue fruit are accented by high-toned spices and milk chocolate. Flavors are soft, palate coating and poised, with blue-fruit flavors lingering on the finish. It doesn't necessarily taste like Merlot but still brings plenty of appeal.",88,15.0
2791,Columbia Crest,"The aromas leap out of the glass, with notes of freshly peeled tangerine, white flowers, jasmine and honeysuckle. It drinks quite sweet but manages to stay in balance. It's a delicious example of this variety. Enjoy it for dessert.",88,30.0
2792,Casa Santos Lima,"This wine swings between structure and ripe fruitiness. With a dense tannic background, the foreground has jammy, black fruits and a rich character. Not a wine for long aging, it's attractive now and ready to drink from 2016.",88,12.0
2793,Foxen,"The most forward and drinkable of Foxen's many new 2011 Pinot Noirs. It's soft and juicy with raspberries and cherry flavors, plus subtleties of cola, sautéed wild mushrooms and sweet, toasty sandalwood. A pretty wine that's perfect with lamb.",89,48.0
2794,Foxen,"Tightly wound now, with firm acids and tannins providing a good structure. There's a solid core of cherries and currants, but it's obscured. Needs time. Give it 4–5 years in a proper cellar.",89,62.0
2795,Gary Farrell,"The vineyard is near Sebastopol and the Green Valley, and the wine shows its cool-climate origins in the brisk terroir that gives the raspberry, sweet red cherry and persimmon fruit such bite. It's enormously attractive to drink now for sheer lusciousness, but has the integrity to age for 10–15 years, perhaps longer, depending on your taste for older Pinot.",92,55.0
2796,Williams Selyem,"This fresh, softly mellow and creamy wine is utterly captivating with bright summer red-berry and tree-fruit, vanilla, cherry liqueur, brown sugar and toast flavors. Absolutely delicious now, it is a silky feast for the senses and should easily negotiate the next 8–10 years.",92,75.0
2797,Williams Selyem,"This is a pretty Pinot that's light and silky on the palate, and comforting in its moderate alcohol and spicy, exotic flavors. It offers waves of wild forest berry pie, baking spice, sweet-and-sour persimmon and sandalwood flavors that are intriguingly complex. Absolutely delightful now.",92,49.0
2798,Undurraga,"This Casablanca SB opens with crisp, dry, capped aromas of ocean foam, citrus and green herbs. It's true to form in the mouth, with nice acidity and citrusy zest. Flavors of citrus and green herbs are focused but pithy, while the finish is fresh, crisp and tastes of lime and thyme.",89,20.0
2799,Iron Horse,"Grilled mushroom and a gamy note define this wine, from the highest point of the winery's estate. It's velvety thick, smoky, concentrated and forested in flavor, with strong accents of dried herb.",88,85.0
2800,Williams Selyem,"Bright melon, lemongrass, kaffir lime and Anjou pear aromas show on the very citrusy nose of this low-alcohol, high-residual-sugar bottling. The viscous sip is expectedly sweet, with lime0-mousse flavors and a decent acidity that cuts through the palate.",88,40.0
2801,Bründlmayer,"The pale salmon color and dry palate are the chief attractions of this light-bodied, dry wine. Berry fruit is subdued but enlivened by citrus and notes of white pepper. It's very fresh and refreshing. Drink as soon as possible.",87,10.0
2802,V. Sattui,"A density of honey and caramel washes over this vineyard-designate, a concentrated and viscous expression of the variety. Layered in light waves of lemon, it finishes with a bite of ripe yellow apple and more of that caramel.",89,38.0
2803,Louis Jadot,"With a toasty character, this is a classic of its kind, with ripe fruit and an attractive slice of lemon. A mineral edge to this spicy wine gives a fresh texture at the end. It should age a few months, so drink from 2016.",89,28.0
2804,Columbia Crest,"Les Chevaux blends 48% Merlot, 46% Cabernet Sauvignon, 4% Cabernet Franc and 2% Syrah, yielding a wine that is smooth, supple, and complete. It has both roundness and depth, and a lovely melding of cherry, chocolate and tobacco.",90,15.0
2805,Testarossa,"So delicious, so dazzlingly seductive, it's impossible not to fall in love with this wine. It detonates on the palate with an explosion of cherries and raspberries, and wonderfully smoky, buttery complexities from oak. Drily crisp and finely structured in smooth, dense tannins, it offers great pleasure now, and should develop over the next 6–8 years. Production was low, but it's worth a search.",95,56.0
2806,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"The aromas pop, with notes of brown sugar, dried pear and honey. The palate is incredibly rich and intense but with high-wire acidity that keeps all of the flavors in vivid focus. The sense of balance is exquisite.",92,40.0
2807,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"A ripe wine reflecting the richness of the vintage, this is full of light mineral notes backed by generous white fruit. Creamed apple and plum flavors dominate, lifted by lasting crisp acidity. Drink from late 2017.",89,27.0
2808,Wines & Winemakers,"This ripe, juicy wine is full of rich tannins that are seamlessly integrated into its generous black fruit. It shows spice from wood aging, jammy fruitiness and balanced acidity. Ready to drink now for its delicious fruit, it will continue to develop until 2024.",89,18.0
2809,Wines & Winemakers,"Crisp lemon and green apple flavors shine through this lively, fruity wine. It has a cool character, tangy fruitiness and a touch of pepper. The wine is made to drink in its youth and is ready now.",89,14.0
2810,Fess Parker,"A lovely Pinot Noir for drinking now. Could be a bit more intense, and finishes rather quickly, but in between is a nice, dry, silky wine, with soft, intricate cherry, cola, spice and sandalwood flavors.",87,55.0
2811,Kunde,"Juicy in dusty berry cobbler flavor, layered with a touch of spicy dark chocolate, this is a medium-bodied, approachable wine with well-integrated oak and supple tannin. Blackberry and coffee mingle on the finish.",88,22.0
2812,Wines & Winemakers,"Firm, with a mineral texture that reflects the tough terrain of the Douro, this wine is also full of fine red fruits and acidity. It has young tannins as well as oak flavors that give the wine a dry core. Drink this firm wine from 2018.",88,18.0
2813,Siduri,"Deep purple fruits, black sage, big cherry and woody spices arise from this wine by Adam Lee, who recently sold to Jackson Family Wines but will remain in charge. The palate shows crushed clove and allspice, licorice, graphite and more dark fruit flavors.",90,33.0
2814,Bründlmayer,"This has a fleshy core of red cherry fruit and a prominent acidic backbone, making this a satisfying, food-friendly wine.",85,
2815,Concha y Toro,"Resiny oak on top of tropical fruit, apple and melon aromas announce plenty of barrel influence. The mouthfeel is plump and offers just enough acidity to balance out the wine's high oak level. Flavors of spiced apple and melon finish woody.",85,18.0
2816,Trapiche,"Piercing aromas of char and creosote are like a laser pop surrounded by a note of blackberry. This is raw, tannic and hard on the palate. Chunky berry flavors are heavily oaked, while this is jammy in feel and tastes of blueberry on the finish. Drink through 2021.",90,55.0
2817,Louis Jadot,"Attractive ripe and creamy, this has soft acidity along with apple and pineapple flavors. It is smooth with a fresh character that gives a lift at the end.",86,15.0
2818,Williams Selyem,"This is a rare premier release from the winery's new vineyard. It's a blend of different clones, and only 47 cases were produced. The wine is very exotic. It shows tiers of raspberries and cherries, but also more feral notes, of dried meats or leather, mushrooms, tart balsam, tangy minerals and scads of dusty, sweet Indian spices. Tannic and dry, it should unfold slowly over the next 10 years.",94,68.0
2819,Fess Parker,"Sour cherry, cranberry, iron, dust and a touch of game appear on the nose of this always-reliable appellation blend from the late actor's family winery, which is still run by his descendants. The flavors are mellow in presentation, with cranberry, fennel and a touch of Early Grey tea.",88,30.0
2820,Lynmar,"This darkly-colored wine is a little on the heavy, fruity side for a rosé. But it's fantastically delicious, offering waves of berries, cola and spices. The acidity is refreshingly high. You can drink this instead of a red wine with lighter meats, such as lamb or pork.",90,25.0
2821,Testarossa,"From a historic vineyard planted in 1971, this bottling show savory and dark notes of strawberry, raspberry, licorice, slate, sage and a touch of oak smoke. The palate boasts earthy structure and vibrant acidity, with flavors of slightly bitter cherry fruit, beet juice and bay leaf.",93,64.0
2822,Lynmar,"A bold, chewy expression of the variety, Summit exhibits its 15% whole-cluster fermentation. It also is given more oak, a chance to tame its wild black cherry and lush cola spice. Black tea and a trace of red fruit play into the personality of the wine, adding a brightness to what is otherwise a decadent, full-throttle wine, barely tamed at that. Drink now through 2023.",93,70.0
2823,Lynmar,"From a vineyard off of Lakeville Highway in the heart of the Petaluma Gap, drilled by winds, this is a concentrated, thick-skinned wine, dark and oaky. A fistful of earthy mushroom, herb and forest surrounds a foundation of blueberry compote and cola, the acidity high and well mannered. Drink now through 2023.",93,70.0
2824,Montes,"Subtle, alluring aromas of earth, cola, eucalyptus, fallen leaves, black cherry and cassis properly announce this saturated, well-balanced Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend. Dark, toasty, baked flavors of blackberry come with vanilla, herb and tobacco accents. The finish feels great while tasting integrated and complex. Drink through 2024.",93,90.0
2825,Robert Mondavi,"From the winery's historic To Kalon Vineyard in Oakville, one of few sites in the state to nurture old-vine Sauvignon Blanc, this wine is complex and compelling. It balances between green olive, basil, thyme and crisp squeezes of lemon. Subtle in oak, it maintains buoyant acidity throughout.",93,50.0
2826,Testarossa,"Testarossa's annual best-barrel offering starts with broad aromas of violets, blackberry tea and anise on the edges. It's a lighter Pinot density-wise, very soft and expressive with purple fruits, black olive and a fennel-powered acidify on the finish.",90,81.0
2827,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"The luscious fruit mix starts with a suggestion of marmalade, then adds plum and cherry. It gains complexity with streaks of graphite, black olive and smoke, polished, lightly earthy tannins and plenty of power through the finish. An interesting, somewhat unusual style of Ethos.",91,38.0
2828,Testarossa,"Smells of rust, iron, tomato and untracked peppercorns rise to the nose. On the palate, the wine is quite light and racy, with a little boysenberry and more sanguine flavors. Hold onto this one until 2016 for maximum enjoyment, as more flavors will emerge.",88,61.0
2829,Trapiche,"This is lightly perfumed with green melon, lychee and papaya aromas. The palate is middle of the road in terms of acidity and snap. Flavors of lychee, peach and nectarine are typical of the variety, while the finish is plump and smooth.",88,18.0
2830,Siduri,"A delicate, almost fragile wine, this opens with tart fruit flavors of strawberry and red plum. There's more than enough acidity, smooth tannins, and a graceful flow to the wine, ending with a light dusting of cocoa.",88,42.0
2831,Casa Santos Lima,"Blending Chardonnay and Viognier with local grapes, the wine is smooth and creamy. It has apple and bright citrus flavors with a cool, crisp backdrop of acidity. The aftertaste, with its tangy, salty character is a reminder of the ocean climate of the region.",86,10.0
2832,Foxen,"This savory young wine has forward flavors of pineapples, Meyer lemons and green apple sauce. However, there's a brisk, underlying minerality and great acidity, making the wine seem exceptionally clean. Try pairing it with broiled or fried chicken and cole slaw.",87,28.0
2833,Foxen,"Lots of ripe, luscious raspberry, cherry and mocha fruit in this Cabernet. It has good acidity and some fine tannins. One drawback is the finish, which is rich in brown sugar and glycerine, with high alcohol. Drink up.",87,42.0
2834,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"The aromas are vibrant, with notes of pear, honeysuckle and peach. The palate is full flavored, dry as promised, with a zing of tart acidity that stitches it all together. It's an outstanding value that shows a beautiful sense of balance.",89,9.0
2835,Kendall-Jackson,"Held back probably to tame fierce acidity, and it's still a young, lean, tart wine. Fresh, juicy flavors of lemons drink very clean and vibrant, but it's austere stuff. Try with goat cheese on toast.",88,22.0
2836,Kendall-Jackson,"Offers a smooth, creamy mouthfeel and a red plum-fruit core, with caramel and tobacco accents. Aromas are of figs and Indian spices; one reviewer found the fruit a bit candied. This is a very good Cab, drinkable in the near term, though not one that necessarily merits such a lofty price tag. Finishes with bitter chocolate.",88,100.0
2837,Louis Jadot,"With spice and wood right up front, this wine is toasty and rich. It has a creamy texture along with bright acidity and a generous body. The wine, with its smooth, ripe aftertaste, is of course young. Drink from 2017.",91,82.0
2838,Louis Latour,"While this wine has roundness and a ripe, rich character, it is also fresh, aromatic and cut with intense acidity. A touch of honey gives a softer, almost sweeter edge to this otherwise crisp wine. It is still bringing the fruit and the mineral texture together, so drink from 2018.",91,
2839,Louis Latour,"Rich and full in the mouth, this wine has a ripe, yellow fruit and honeyed character. This contrasts with the fragrant acidity and the steely edge that cuts the ripeness. It's a wine that demands aging, so drink from 2018.",91,
2840,Bründlmayer,"The shy nose gives away a flinty hint of reduction. The palate has a juicier, easier quality where green pear, slightly earthy yeast and fresh citrus are drawn together. The body is light, fresh and very invigorating. With a little air, more aromas awake and present notions of Conference pear and yeasty saltiness.",91,31.0
2841,Columbia Crest,"The aromas in this wine pop, with notes of dried herb, plum, vanilla and smoked meat. It brings a compelling sense of texture, coating the palate from end to end with exquisitely balanced fruit and savory flavors. It's a knockout at this price.",91,12.0
2842,Columbia Crest,"For lovers of lush, buttery Chardonnay, this is the one to seek out. Generously toasty barrel flavors complement spicy pineapple fruit. It's forward, full-bodied and ready to drink now.",88,12.0
2843,Iron Horse,"The blend is Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. The Brut X designation refers to the winery's driest sparkler, but the wine retains plenty of sweet, ripe strawberries, raspberries, limes, vanilla and honey. It's very good, but a minor critique is a certain roughness of texture. Drink now.",88,50.0
2844,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"This is a crisp, clean and nicely-structured Chardonnay, fermented in a mix of new and neutral oak, along with some stainless steel. A bit beer-like and yeasty at first, it opens into pleasing flavors of grapefruit and pineapple, with just the right amount of acidity.",88,11.0
2845,Columbia Crest,"Fermented in concrete, then aged on lees for five months, this is a pretty expression of Chardonnay with popcorn butter, cream and white peach leading to a tart finish.",88,20.0
2846,Kunde,"From the producer's estate, this zesty wine is easygoing and softly tart, a mix of plum, strawberry and leathery texture that should shine next to a pizza pie.",88,30.0
2847,Kunde,"Thick in bittersweet tannins, akin to tobacco, this is a big, full-bodied wine with a richness of raspberry and blackberry that becomes juicy on the midpalate before finishing lean.",86,42.0
2848,Williams Selyem,"Rather heavy in texture, a big, full-bodied and tannic Pinot that seems overly extracted and oaky. The vintage was very difficult due to early September heat waves, and everything depended on exquisite timing. It's very good, despite the rusticity. Drink now through 2012.",87,72.0
2849,Casa Santos Lima,"Fresh and really juicy, this blend of Tinta Roriz and Castelão has black currant flavors that are underlined by good wood aging. The acidity is a balanced component of this easy, ready-to-drink wine. Great fruitiness shows at the end.",88,
2850,Concha y Toro,"Nettle and gritty citrus aromas suggest matchstick. In the mouth, this SB pumps citrus notes and minerality, while flavors of tangerine, lime and lemon are zesty and shearing. An acid-driven finish confirms the wine's one-note, chiseled quality.",88,23.0
2851,DFJ Vinhos,"Almost black in color, this densely tannic wine is granular, dusty and mineral in character. The berry fruits shoulder the weight of the tannins easily, giving a ripe wine that will need until 2016 to develop fully",88,10.0
2852,Iron Horse,"A triumph, really. Held back for 14 years and just recently disgorged, it's fantastically rich and complex, just oozing the most delicious orange, butterscotch, yeast and toast flavors. So silky, so sweet in fruit, and yet with a dry finish. Stands out in any tasting of the best sparklers. Hard to imagine a California bubbly better than this.",97,179.0
2853,Foxen,"You want decadence, opulence and fabulosity in your Chardonnay? This one's for you. It's tremendous in ripe pineapple, pear, peach, mango, lime, tangerine and papaya flavors. So much fruit, while the oak application is never heavy handed, applying just the right touch of buttered toast. Where does all that vanilla honey come from? A magnificent example of a first-growth California Chardonnay, at a great price.",96,32.0
2854,Bründlmayer,"Always the star of sweet wines, this TBA Riesling preserves so much freshness while also being packed with honeyed, ripe apricot and mango fruits. It is the acidity along with the dry botrytis that make the wine so special and offer considerable aging potential— give it seven years or more.",95,
2855,Chanson Père et Fils,"With green apple aromas, a bright freshness and a light touch of toast, this is already a balanced, delicious wine.",88,60.0
2856,Georges Duboeuf,"From one of the estates that Duboeuf bottles separately, the wine is fruity and soft. It has attractive red fruits and light, well-integrated tannins. A touch of cherry pepper character gives it a lift. Drink now.",86,15.0
2857,Casa Santos Lima,"With partial aging in wood, this is a spicy, smoky wine that is also full of ripe red fruits. Well-integrated tannins give shape to this wine. A crisp aftertaste and the wine is ready to drink.",85,10.0
2858,DFJ Vinhos,"This is a soft, ripe and fruity wine. Smooth and lightly textured, its unusual blend of Pinot Noir, Shiraz and Castelão is generous and spicy with good final acidity. Drink now.",85,9.0
2859,DFJ Vinhos,"This is an off-dry wine, soft with a touch of tannin. It has some attractive acidity to keep it crisp as well as ripe red fruits. Drink now.",85,9.0
2860,Testarossa,"Toast, iodine, steel and kumquat-skin aromas show on this bottling from one of the region's older properties. The palate offers stone fruit ripeness but is driven by a sharp, citrusy acidity of Meyer lemon and Mexican lime.",90,48.0
2861,Kunde,"Tightly tannic, this 100% varietal wine comes from the producer's family estate. It's big in blackberry fruit and oak, the tannins generous on the palate. Ripe, plush plums figure into the finish, the wine bound to appeal to fans of Zinfandel for its robust nature.",87,35.0
2862,Columbia Crest,"As comfortable as an old shoe, the Grand Estates Chardonnay from Columbia Crest delivers broad, open flavors of buttered fruit – almost like biting into a slice of apple pie, crust and all. Hard to argue with it, all 160,000 cases strong.",86,11.0
2863,Lynmar,"This highly accessible, reasonably priced Chardonnay sees no new oak. It offers aromatics of orange blossom and fresh-squeezed lemon followed by a lean texture of more lemon, honeysuckle and melon. Stock up.",90,25.0
2864,Casa Santos Lima,"The ripe fruit of this Shiraz and Touriga Nacional blend exude a character of richness and sophistication. Dusty tannins provide the framework for red fruit flavors and the generous structure. From José Luís Santos Lima Oliveira da Silva's range, the wine would be best after 2015.",90,15.0
2865,Concha y Toro,"A bold and chunky customer with multiple personalities. The nose has big black fruit, smoke, leather, barrel char and even some wet dog smells, while the palate is easygoing and full, with herbal, roasted fruit and spice. Long and mostly true on the finish. Uncomplicated but solid.",86,12.0
2866,Concha y Toro,"Like most Casillero varietals, this Merlot offers good concentration and a mix of berry fruit and light herbal aromas. The palate is lively, with good acidity and zesty red plum and pie cherry flavors. It's a little tangy throughout but on the plus side it's not overdone or heavy.",86,10.0
2867,Montes,"A bulky wine with aromas of dried herbs, pepper and black fruits. It's meaty and thick in the mouth, with grapey, herbal flavors. Unfolds fairly nicely on the finish, with the wine's herbal character locking in. A good example of Chilean Malbec that's more basic than complex.",86,12.0
2868,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"The blend includes 18% Syrah, which helps to emphasize the spice and sweet fruit flavors. But in the back, this is a stiff and fairly tannic wine, with a disconnect between the strawberry fruit and the slightly stemmy, herbal finish.",85,18.0
2869,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Aged in a mixture of French oak (32% new) and stainless steel, it shows the best of both with fresh peach notes and barrel spices intermingling with crème fraîche. It's creamy in feel with the concentration winnowing slightly toward the finish.",89,22.0
2870,Chehalem,"Sappy and deep, this brings a mouth-pleasing mix of citrus and stone fruits, broadening into a full midpalate. Full-bodied, it puts the emphasis on fruit, with just a trace of minerality.",91,21.0
2871,Georges Duboeuf,"Intense and rich wine, with touches of smoky wood, the tannins ripe, the acidity a refreshing balancing factor. With its cherry character, there is fruit already, but wait a year and this will be impressive.",91,18.0
2872,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"Rounded and honeyed, this is a wine that shows a sweeter side of Pinot Blanc, buoyed by fresh, juicy white-peach flavor. Full, rich and dense, this is fruity, yet it has a complex structure.",89,24.0
2873,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"This is rich and concentrated, spice as well as pear and melon flavors. It is complex, with almond and nutmeg notes, balanced by the taut acidity that completes a full, ripe wine.",89,24.0
2874,Kunde,"This fine wine straddles the border between good and complex. The elements are terrific: pedigreed blackberry and cassis fruit, fine oak nuances, and soft Sonoma tannins. It's just a tad thin in the middle. Drink it with meat.",87,25.0
2875,Montes,"Cream, plus jammy blackberry and blueberry aromas may trick you into believing that this wine's a Syrah, but the truth comes through on the palate, where sturdy, brambly blackberry flavors dominate. Finishes dry, with medium length.",87,16.0
2876,Fess Parker,"Starts with an explosion of crushed white pepper and roasted, charred notes, with a suggestion of blackberries. Drinks round, soft and flavorful, a full-bodied red with velvety tannins and fresh acidity. This flattering, dry wine is versatile and easy to drink.",87,20.0
2877,Santa Ema,"Bright, ripe fruit is the name of the game in the mouth, where blackberry and red plum are countered with a manageable amount of oak. Tannins are chalky; bouquet and finish are more subtle and a little oakier.",87,10.0
2878,Iron Horse,"A very good Chardonnay, fancy and elegant, although it's a little sharp in the mouth, and lacks a certain hedonistic appeal, especially at this price. Shows dry, oak-inspired flavors of pineapples, green apples and pears, with a firm minerality.",90,46.0
2879,Kendall-Jackson,"Tasting off-dry, this has flavors of citrus, vanilla, buttercream, honey and spice, which are brightened by crisp acidity.",85,13.0
2880,Kunde,"This wine is very rich and ripe with tangerine, Meyer-lemon and peach flavors, but with a stimulating cut of green grass. Crisp acidity and super-clean winemaking gives it a finish that's pure and intense. Another fine bottling from this veteran winery.",87,17.0
2881,Chehalem,"A pretty purple-hued wine, Chehalem's Gamay Noir invites sipping with flavors of blueberries, chocolate and spice. It's fruity and forward, but seems to suddenly hit a wall, stopping short with a hint of plastic in the finish.",87,24.0
2882,DFJ Vinhos,"This is a rich wine, smoky with vanilla and apple flavors. It has some good intensity, as well as a textured character that gives it some aging potential. Bright, fresh acidity cuts through the riper fruits. Drink now and until 2019.",87,9.0
2883,V. Sattui,"Aromas like melon and almond, then flavors like peach and honey make a sophisticated blend in this dry, light-bodied wine. It has vibrant acidity for good balance and richness in texture that lingers on the finish. The name refers to the egg-shaped concrete vats used for fermentation.",89,25.0
2884,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Exotic spice, toast, espresso and mature black-skinned fruit aromas lead the nose. The palate is rather austere, showing dried berry, spearmint, ground pepper and wild herb alongside aggressive tannins that clench the finish. Give the tannins a few more years to soften then drink up.",88,75.0
2885,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Fragrant and fresh, this sleek red offers scents of wild berry and just-picked violet. The smooth palate provides juicy red cherry, crushed raspberry and a hint of spice alongside bright acidity and supple tannins. Enjoy now.",88,18.0
2886,Lynmar,"From a section of the producer's Quail Hill Vineyard, this wine sings with smoky sage and forest floor notes, its tingling acidity emphasizing freshness. Its backbone of thick tannins offers strength and power, contrasting more delicate layers of blueberry flavor.",94,80.0
2887,Williams Selyem,"Baked bread, pine forest and strawberry rise out of the glass in this relatively light yet complex and layered wine, spicy in cinnamon and black tea. It shows the powerful grace of good winemaking, showcasing the appellation's beauty and brawn from a warm, even year.",94,55.0
2888,Williams Selyem,"Another triumph of fine winemaking, this appellation wine is leathery and full bodied, wild and savory in tea, strawberry hull and rocky earth. It shines in subtle acidity and plenty of structure, with ample body to support its angular temptations.",94,55.0
2889,Bründlmayer,"Fresh but creamy notes of ripe Conference pear on the nose mute into a peppery, herbal, yeast-savory palate with verve and freshness of utter typicity. This is textbook Grüner that offers the full and perfect package of spice, freshness and fruit on a light but concentrated body. The finish is both long and clean.",93,32.0
2890,Casa Santos Lima,"This single vineyard wine shows its pedigree with firm tannins and structured fruit. It is serious wine, designed for aging with its structure, wood aging aromas and perfumed fruits. It is a blend of Tinta Roriz and Castelão which together bring out both tight texture and fruitiness. The wine needs to age, so drink from 2018.",90,15.0
2891,Maryhill,"A blend of Merlot, Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon, this is indeed a sturdy red table wine. The tannins are dense and chewy, the fruit submerged beneath barrel flavors of toast, caramel and nougat. It spent 20 months in 50% new French oak.",87,32.0
2892,Maryhill,"Forward and lightly spicy, this is a good, all-purpose white wine, with bright flavors of apple and pear. It's not a big wine in any way, but perfectly quaffable and right for a wide variety of noodle dishes.",87,12.0
2893,Montes,"This is fresh, with good pungency and a mix of passion fruit and bell pepper aromas. A scouring mouthfeel pulls no punches, while grassy, slightly bitter flavors of arugula and lemon-lime finish citrusy and tangy.",87,13.0
2894,Santa Ema,"Plum and raspberry aromas are fresh, clean and simple. This is a solid, full-bodied Cabernet with currant and plum flavors accented by notes of herbs and spices. A minty, lightly herbal finish feels fresh and healthy.",87,10.0
2895,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Aromas of barrel spice, vanilla, dill and blue-black fruit are bright and focused. The plum and barrel flavors show depth and a sense of texture, with lingering flavors. This wine is not typically Cabernet but it offers much appeal.",90,18.0
2896,DFJ Vinhos,"DFJ was the first to plant Alvarinho in the Lisbon region. This wine shows tropical flavors, pineapple as well as apricots. This richness is layered by a mineral texture as well as final, bright acidity. Drink from 2016.",89,13.0
2897,Foxen,"Ripe boysenberry, root beer and mocha latte aromas make for a dynamic, delicious nose on this bottling from Foxen's seven-acre estate vineyard. The flavors range from black pepper and roasted meats to dried thyme, sagebrush and black licorice, all set against emerging tannins and a long, lingering finish.",94,48.0
2898,Wines & Winemakers,"Big in every sense, this powerful, almost black-colored wine is solid, packed with dry tannins and ripe fruit. Made from Alicante Bouschet, it is a rich, opulent wine, with a strong spice, pepper and fruit character. This blockbuster needs aging, so drink from 2018.",93,77.0
2899,Chanson Père et Fils,"Powerful and structured, this wine is dark with black fruits. The rich fruit and acidity are surrounded by firm tannins provide a solid scaffolding. With acidity and tannins at the end, this complex wine will age slowly, so don't drink before 2022.",95,330.0
2900,Albert Bichot,"This wine has power along with great fruit and a rich structure. Yellow fruits are laced with a more finessed texture that adds minerality. It is a dense wine, full of fruit, with a measured touch of wood. Age this until 2021.",95,185.0
2901,Albert Bichot,"This dense and complex wine comes from one of the magnificent Grand Cru vineyards in Morey Saint-Denis. It is a powerful wine with its rich, generous fruit and dense tannins. It has everything larger than life: big fruit, big tannins and a big future. Drink this exceptional wine from 2024.",95,295.0
2902,Chanson Père et Fils,"This wine is dense and severely tannic. It has dense ripe-fruit flavors as well, although they are buried under the power of the structure. For a wine of such impressive character that is not a bad thing, it just indicates that it needs time to mature and will age well. Drink from 2023.",95,455.0
2903,Chanson Père et Fils,"Ripe and full of red berry aromas and flavors, this is a generous, warm wine. It has great swathes of juicy acidity and an attractive touch of toasty, spicy wood that is integrating well with the fruit. The tannic structure offers good support for the bright acidity and rich fruitiness. Drink from 2020.",94,89.0
2904,Kendall-Jackson,"Light pink, with a slight orange color in the glass, this widely available rosé shows strawberry, orange rind and a tiny bit of bubblegum on the delicate nose. It's a tad flat on the palate, with soft flavors of red cherry and yellow plum.",86,17.0
2905,Wines & Winemakers,"This blend of Syrah, Petit Verdot, Aragonez and Alicante Bouschet shows power, with dense tannins shouldered by ripe black fruit flavors and a solid structure. From the Estremoz region of the Alentejo, it's a powerhouse of flavors and juicy acidity. Drink after 2016.",88,23.0
2906,DFJ Vinhos,"Smooth and light, it's all about fruitiness, crisp apples and a squeeze of lemon juice that perks up the soft texture. It's fresh and ready to drink.",86,7.0
2907,DFJ Vinhos,"Light and fruity, this is an immediately attractive, fragrant, off-dry wine. With its red berry flavors, it tastes warm and inviting. The touch of acidity reinforces the bright drinkability.",86,7.0
2908,Undurraga,"Floral soap, plum and red-berry aromas bring a pinch of spice to the nose. This is lively and a bit of a grinder on the palate, with zingy acidity and some grit. Plum, berry and ripe tomato flavors finish short and simple.",86,11.0
2909,Santa Ema,"The 2010 vintage in Chile was quite cool, and that's reflected in this wine. Aromas of berry fruits are lean and underdeveloped. In the mouth, this shows astringency and rubbery tannins, while flavors of red fruits are slightly sharp and a touch green. Drying tannins make for a drawing finish.",86,22.0
2910,Wines & Winemakers,"Made at Casa Emelinda Freitas in Setúbal, this is part of the nationwide range of wines under the Azul Portugal name. The Castelão grape dominates this spicy wine with its bold tannins and juicy red fruits. With its smooth texture, it's ready to drink.",86,11.0
2911,Wines & Winemakers,"This blend of Fernão Pires and Arinto is soft, fresh and fruity. Juicy green plums, citrus and bright acidity all give a lively character. A tangy texture needs several months aging. It will be best at the end of the 2014.",86,11.0
2912,Undurraga,"Toasty, inviting aromas of apple and melon lead to a balanced palate with layered flavors of resiny oak, pear and peach. The finish continues with resin and oak, but by then it has already established itself as a well-balanced wine, with tasty flavors of white and tropical fruit.",88,16.0
2913,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"This is just this side of unctuous, a decadently ripe and rich late harvest Riesling. The residual sugar is at 23%, the alcohol a moderate 8%, and the balance impeccable, with a buoyant underpinning to the intense sweetness. It avoids sugary granularity as well, offering seamless, concentrated fruit that piles on flavors of peach, apricot, banana, mango, papaya and melon in wild profusion, trailing into sweet tea and honey. Apart from the winery's Single Berry Select Trockenbeerenauslese project with Ernie Loosen, this is the best dessert wine made in Washington.",96,40.0
2914,Testarossa,"Of all Testarossa's 2006 Pinots, this is the most complex, and also the most ageworthy. Offers a flood of cherry, red currant, Dr. Pepper, raspberry, licorice, vanilla cookie and oaky spice flavors that are fantastically intense and interesting. Interestingly, this bottling is one of Testarossa's highest-alcohol Pinots. Great now and for a good six more years.",96,75.0
2915,Maryhill,"A lot of this Cabernet-Merlot-Syrah-Cab Franc blend is produced, and for the money it gives you plenty of enjoyment. Soft raspberry fruit seems loaded with oak-derived flavors. Toast, vanilla, bare wood, even a streak of cola come through. The wine drinks far more mature than the recent vintage, so drink up.",86,12.0
2916,Chanson Père et Fils,"Beautifully perfumed in a relatively light style, this Santenay is full of red fruits, sweet tannins and mouthwatering acidity. It has some richness, although the main character is of freshness.",89,60.0
2917,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Made from Cold Creek and Wahluke Slope fruit, this pure Syrah is compact and dense, and it reveals blueberry and boysenberry flavors that are set in a frame of coffee-flavored tannins. The acids are suggestive of lemon verbena, and the 15.5% alcohol shows a little heat in the the throat.",89,35.0
2918,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Part of a Limited Release series, this wine includes 17% Syrah, but the varietal character of the Mourvèdre shines through. Light touches of chocolate, clean earth and mineral underscore flavors of plum and cherry. There is also a streak of vanilla, perhaps from aging in French and American oak.",89,25.0
2919,Wines & Winemakers,"A typical local blend of Arinto, Fernão Pires and Chardonnay, this is smooth, ripe and creamy. It has touches of herb, honey and pineapple, which are laced together by citrusy acidity. The finish is soft.",89,15.0
2920,Louis Jadot,"Fruity and fragrant, this Savigny shows extra weight that makes it serious and age worthy. The wine's tannins are cushioned by the generous red fruits, which promise aging potential. Wood and spice flavors emphasize the finish.",89,50.0
2921,Undurraga,"Opens with hard, tight, rubbery aromas of black cherry and blackberry. The palate is deep and tannic, with a vise-like grip and dark, herbal flavors of cassis, plum and berry. The finish, not surprisingly, maintains the wine's dark, rubbery, pushy character.",88,29.0
2922,Williams Selyem,"Tropical stone fruit and wild honey rise from the nose of this exquisite white wine, from a spot smack in the middle of the appellation. High-toned citrus lifts the acidity to refreshing, supporting levels, a mix of Meyer lemon and limestone-like stoniness. A lean, lithe underbelly underlies a heart of apple pie and baked pineapple.",94,58.0
2923,Williams Selyem,"Feral on the nose and palate, awash in cherry but also a savage garden of wild rose, this wine is precociously young. It expands slowly in the glass finally to unleash a ferocity of cranberry and raspberry. Drink 2018 through 2024.",94,78.0
2924,Williams Selyem,"Cherry and orange please the palate immediately, with a subversive note of peat and forest—it's a good commingling of fruit and exotic savory elements that remain memorable through the lengthy complexity of medium-bodied, velvety texture and weight. This wine is so good now it'd be hard to set it down, but it will reward cellaring, through 2024.",94,58.0
2925,Bründlmayer,"An earthy dimension still clings to the zesty notes on the nose but on the palate a whole load of citrus flavors are expressed without strain: For now, lemon and the tangy zest of tangerine carry everything on this slender but concentrated wine to a glorious, totally refreshing finish. This is the glory of youth but with such purity and bundled energy this has a long, promising and decidedly delicious future. Drink 2016–2036.",94,36.0
2926,Foxen,"Dried strawberries, plum and an iron character combine for a lush yet balanced nose on this entry-level bottling from the longtime Foxen Canyon winery. Condensed purple flowers, ripe olallieberries, turned earth and citrus peel show on the energetic palate.",90,38.0
2927,Bründlmayer,"This is as serious as Grüner gets. It's a very rich wine, fully structured, packed with ripe apricot flavors with a touch of lime. The texture is dense, mineral still very young. With concentration and young acidity, it needs to age. Drink from 2017.",93,55.0
2928,Williams Selyem,"The wine shows the fine acidity of the vintage, but also intense flavors of green apples, Asian pears and oranges. Oak brings luscious, balanced notes of vanilla and toast. A gorgeous, sumptuous wine that should drink well for the next six years.",93,50.0
2929,Williams Selyem,"While this vineyard is close by the Russian River and is not considered the best of Rochioli's vineyards, winemaker Bob Cabral consistently makes its grapes into one of Williams Selyem's most compelling wines. This shows the impeccable tannins and acids of Rochioli fruit, with sweet, ripe, deep flavors of cherry and spice. Notes of pomegranate, rum punch, dark chocolate and smoky sandalwood add complexity. Beautiful to drink now, it should continue to develop for at least 10 years.",96,78.0
2930,Bründlmayer,"Pure and fruity, this has a fine line of steely acidity that cuts through the crisp apple fruit. The Loiser Berg is a south-facing, sheltered site that helps to create a taut wine with considerable aging potential. Keep for 4–5 years.",95,
2931,Williams Selyem,"This shows the extraordinary richness and complexity that the winery's estate vineyard has exhibited over its lifetime. It's vast in cherry, red currant and licorice flavors, plus multiple layers of sautéed mushroom, exotic baking spice, mineral and sweet, smoky sandalwood. It's also very tannic, with a brisk spine of acidity. Good as it is, it needs time for all the parts to knit together. Better after 2018.",95,100.0
2932,Bründlmayer,"The lyra system of training vines is designed to give the fruit maximum exposure. With that and the vines' placement on the steep Heiligenstein hill, it's no surprise that this wine is ripe and rich. Perfumed, intense and generous, this will age for many years.",95,71.0
2933,Williams Selyem,"For sheer voluptuous pleasure, this is one of Williams Sel-yem's best 2010s. It just floods the mouth with flavors of raspberry and cherry Pop-Tarts, with the most wonderful array of spices and a tender use of oak. Hard to keep from drinking it now, but it should age well over the next 8–10 years.",95,58.0
2934,Testarossa,"Absolutely delicious. Although it's a bit full bodied and heavy for a Pinot Noir, it's stunningly good, offering wave after wave of berry, cherry, orange peel, spice and oak flavors, with interesting side notes of mushrooms, cola, cocoa and licorice. The California appellation is because the wine is a best barrel blend from Testarossa's vineyards up and down the state. Drink now–2015.",94,75.0
2935,Undurraga,"Named after a work by the Chilean poet Vicente Huidobro, this spicy, earthy, slightly herbal blend of mostly Carmenère and Carignan offers aromas of tobacco, licorice root and anise. The palate is tight and fresh, but with padding. Earthy berry, hoja santa and tobacco flavors finish with a touch of oak and related graphite. Drink through 2023.",92,50.0
2936,Fess Parker,"Distinct aromas of sour plum and dried pomegranate meet with damp tobacco, forest floor, green olive and Greek spice on the nose of this clonal study. It's herbal on the palate, with oregano, marjoram and green cardamom notes, alongside cranberry and red cherry fruit in the midpalate. Altogether, it's a light, bright and highly seasoned wine.",92,55.0
2937,Lynmar,"This intensely powerful wine is named in honor of the winery's co-proprietor and founder. Chewy and earthy, it's concentrated and robust, strong in black-cherry cola and truffle. From the estate vineyard surrounding the winery, it's for those who love their Pinots bold and velvety.",93,70.0
2938,Bründlmayer,"Cabernet Franc's aromatic, lovely leafiness cannot be denied and beckons you to taste. The palate is of classic stature: fine-boned, poised, dense with finely woven Cabernet tannins, fleshed out with the charming plum fruit of Merlot and spiced with just a little vanilla. Whoever made this had elegance in mind. Wonderfully balanced. Drink 2018–2025.",92,60.0
2939,Robert Mondavi,"This is a straightforward, lush and alluringly tart white that offers an oaky backbone of vanilla wrapped in fresh layers of fig, apple and green olive flavor.",88,20.0
2940,Wines & Winemakers,"This is a rich, full and structured wine with a great balance between black fruit and tannins. It shows the stony minerality of the Douro, with generous fruit and acidity. Drink from 2018.",88,12.0
2941,Testarossa,"Deep black cherry, sarsaparilla and vanilla show on the full and hearty nose of this bottling from the historic vineyard that was planted in the 1970s. It's tightly woven on the palate, with earthy spice and dark red fruits. The acidity holds crisp deep into the finish.",92,65.0
2942,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Made with Italy's popular and historic Falanghina grape and aged on the lees for 14 months, this classic method sparkling wine represents a new turn for southern Italian winemaking that has traditionally shown little interest in bubbles. The results here are promising, with fresh tones of field flower and stone fruit that would pair perfectly with appetizers.",88,40.0
2943,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Here's a confident and pristine expression of Fiano that bursts open with aromas of pear, white melon, acacia flower and honeysuckle. Those fruit and flower flavors build cheerful accents over an otherwise dry and polished mouthfeel.",88,22.0
2944,Louis Jadot,"A blend of grapes from different growers, this is a structured, firm wine. It has a core of drying tannins as well as the bright fruitiness of the vintage. As it develops, that fruit will grow richer and fuller yet always maintaining a crisp edge. Drink from 2019.",90,62.0
2945,Louis Jadot,"Blending grapes from around the appellation, this wine is a fine reflection of its structure and minerality. It's rich and full, while keeping plenty of crisp acidity to contrast its creamy texture. It needs to age for another year, so wait until 2018.",90,79.0
2946,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Serpico is a bold, larger-than-life wine, with beautiful aromatic intensity and notes of black fruit, espresso and crushed granite. Some 18 months of oak aging adds elements of dark spice and smoke; and the wine shows firm tannins and a long, polished mouthfeel. It's very elegant and should withstand many more years of cellar aging.",93,83.0
2947,Concha y Toro,"Opaque in color, with a driving bouquet loaded with graphite, pastry and incredibly ripe black-fruit aromas. Feels rich, but with fine acidity creating superb balance. Tastes like a cascade of blackberry, cassis and chocolate, and then comes a finish of coconut, vanilla and texture. Drink now through 2014; contains 9% Cabernet Sauvignon.",93,150.0
2948,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Light aromas of herb, grass, papaya and kiwi lead to tart, spritely tropical-fruit flavors heightened by grapefruit accents. There's no mistaking the variety and it's appealing, with a drawn-out finish.",90,15.0
2949,Bründlmayer,"Subdued, ripe, yellow pear meets yeasty, almost soy-like savoriness head-on to create a palate full of interest. The wine conveys weight, concentration and a bit of alcoholic heat, but it's all carried of with peppery panache. Lovely now but will only get better.",93,41.0
2950,Robert Mondavi,"This is the winery's first vintage of prominently labeling its reserve-tier Cab under the To Kalon name, a nod to the vineyard's importance in the blend, which is almost all Cabernet Sauvignon, with handfuls of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Soft and structured, it's a subtly powerful wine, offering cassis, cranberry, dried herb and savory touch of black tea.",93,145.0
2951,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"A fine effort in this classic vintage, the Merlot is firm, almost muscular, and dappled with fresh herbs—cilantro and basil. The brambly blackberry fruit has the power to more than hold its own after 18 months in two-thirds new French oak.",91,22.0
2952,V. Sattui,"Tastes more like a Zinfandel than a Cabernet, with a briary mouthfeel and flavors of black pepper and weedy green nettles. But there's lots of blackberry and black currant richness, and the wine is totally dry, with full-bodied, thick tannins. Unusual for a Cabernet, but a nice, complicated red wine for drinking with grilled meats.",89,45.0
2953,Santa Ema,"Opens with floral, cherry, cassis and coconut aromas, which are followed by snappy, acid-driven flavors of raspberry, wood spice and vanilla. A fresh, lively, healthy wine with a toasty/spicy finish and young, clamp-down tannins. Drink now through 2012.",89,24.0
2954,Louis Latour,"Light and fruity, this has a yeasty edge along with acidity. On the palate, there are lots of green fruits, offering a dancing, lively character. At the end, there is a touch of vanilla.",86,30.0
2955,Georges Duboeuf,"Taut and textured, yet ripe and soft, this has a nectarine flavor that's balanced by a note of fresh lime. The finish is easy, nervy and zingy.",86,14.0
2956,Georges Duboeuf,"Full, ripe and creamy, this rolls mellifluously around the palate. Pear and plum flavors dominate along with the crisp edge of lime. The finish is just as rich and smooth.",86,18.0
2957,V. Sattui,"There's lots of sweetness in this polished wine, with pretty orange, peach, vanilla and honeysuckle flavors. It would benefit from greater acidity, though, as it's a bit soft.",86,25.0
2958,Chanson Père et Fils,"This has soft red fruits along with a firm structure of tannins and acids. Shapely and balanced, this is ready to drink now.",86,22.0
2959,V. Sattui,"V. Sattui tries their hand at Grenache, with good results. The wine shows the variety's famed cherry flavors, intense and jammy, along with a good amount of caramelized oak. The winemaker wisely added a bit of Syrah and Petite Sirah, which add body and weight. Ready to drink now.",88,29.0
2960,Iron Horse,"Here is a very pretty pale-salmon-colored sparkling wine, with fine, zesty bubbles and an appealing whiff of Pinot Noir in the nose. The flavors are pure strawberry, a tiny bit sweet but not too much. This is the sort of sparkling wine even people who say they don’t like wine will fall in love with.",90,30.0
2961,Siduri,"Displays intense aromas of beets, cola and black cherries. Some dried bracken scents emerge with airing, adding a woodsy complexity. Fairly rich and powerful, with enough soft tannins and a firm touch of acidity to keep everything together and ensure 5 or more years of longevity.",90,48.0
2962,Iron Horse,"An enormously fruity sparking wine, this one offers complex aromas of raspberries and baked bread, with a hint of lime. It really comes alive in the mouth, thanks to refreshing acidity and fine bubbles that scour the palate. This clean wine has just enough of a dose of sweetness to prod the fruit forward. Only 125 cases produced.",90,26.0
2963,Iron Horse,"This bubbly is simply irresistable, from the pale coppery color to the aromas of raspberries, limes, and apricots to the subtle fruity flavors. The texture is notable for its smooth creaminess, and the wine is dry and very clean. Superb balance suggests ageability, but it’s so delicious now, why wait? 91% Pinot Noir, 9% Chardonnay.",90,28.0
2964,Iron Horse,"A very pale straw color precedes great aromas of peach and apple, with notes of oak, baking bread and white chocolate. It’s delicately fruity in the mouth, with crisp acidity and the pleasant scour of bubbles. This is a clean, elegant wine of great finesse.",89,26.0
2965,Fess Parker,"Fantastically ripe and oaky, a Chardonnay that just swamps the palate with wave after wave of pineapple jam, tangerine tart, apricot pie filling and sweet butterscotch and vanilla flavors. All this richness fortunately is balanced with crisp acidity and a fine tang of minerals.",90,34.0
2966,Georges Duboeuf,"A rich, smoky wine, with some tannins from toast as well as fruit. The sweet red fruits are just ready to push forward to take over from the oak to give a powerful, ageworthy wine.",90,
2967,Albert Bichot,"A creamy wine, with fresh acidity touched with spicy wood. It has the comfortable, plump feel of Meursault, but with some crispness. There are good citrus and white fruit flavors, even apricots, and then the acidity leaves a lifted, lively finish.",88,
2968,Georges Duboeuf,"Firm tannins here and rich fruit underneath, but the wine is spoilt by the banana flavor that intrudes. Perhaps recent bottling has brought this out, in which case a few months wait will see the full potential.",89,15.0
2969,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"This is a tightly structured wine, taut with intense minerality and acidity. It has green fruit and citrus flavors filled out with toast and a creamy texture. The aftertaste, with its tangy minerality, shows the wine will age. Drink from 2020.",93,48.0
2970,Kendall-Jackson,"A bit sharp and green in tannins, this nevertheless provides plenty of cherry, blackberry, black pepper and baking spice flavors to pair with barbecue. The blend is Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Zinfandel.",85,15.0
2971,Wines & Winemakers,"This has some of the concentration you would expect from old vines, along with a lighter, fresher character that gives the wine a lift. It's as much young and fruity as structured, a well-balanced wine that will be ready to drink from 2016.",89,14.0
2972,Columbia Crest,"At first sharp and focused, with sharp aromas of pine and citrus rind, this broadens out and thins quickly once in the mouth. Fresh green apple fruit fades into a smooth, plain, slightly watery finish.",85,12.0
2973,Columbia Crest,"A bit volatile, with a hint of fusil, light herb and cut grass flavors, and fruit that is just ripe enough. Green banana and green apple, with a soft mouthfeel and a gentle fade.",85,15.0
2974,Testarossa,"Black cherry, chipped slate and cola notes lavish the nose on this top-end bottling of best barrels from the single-vineyard specialist. The palate offers much more depth, with ripe alpine strawberry, black plum skins and blackberry fruit, all seasoned by crushed nutmeg and shaved juniper.",93,80.0
2975,Louis Latour,"With a sweet nose of honey, malt and Golden Delicious apples, this is a fairly weighty Chardonnay from an unheralded appellation. The slightly oily herb and peach flavors pick up more butterscotch on the finish, yet remain crisp and clean.",85,14.0
2976,Chanson Père et Fils,"Ripe, jammy fruitiness gives this wine a generous feel. Packed with opulent berry flavor, it will develop well. It is rich and rounded, nicely supported by the tannins that are in the background. Drink from 2019.",92,72.0
2977,Chanson Père et Fils,"This wine is properly steely, tight and with considerable acidity. To balance all this freshness it has layers of ripe yellow fruits that are developing and will likely give a fuller wine in a few years. Drink from 2017.",92,48.0
2978,Georges Duboeuf,"A jolly, fruity wine—very Beaujolais—with a touch of bananas to go with cherry flavors and soft tannins. Ready to drink, and best served slightly chilled.",85,
2979,Casa Santos Lima,"Very juicy and full of acidity, it has an unpleasant metallic edge that gives a bitter aftertaste.",82,
2980,Louis Jadot,"This wine comes from a small Chardonnay enclave in the predominantly red premier cru of Beaune Grèves. With its intense exotic fruit and apricot flavors, it's both ripe and crisp with acidity. That makes for a delicious reflection of the vintage, needing time to mature. Drink from 2020.",92,65.0
2981,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"The flinty but utterly promising scent of reduction still hovers above this wine: clearly this is not meant to be drunk now. The palate underneath already tells of the freshest apple fruit, of depth and purity plus a woody roundness. Let this sleep in your cellar until 2017–2023.",92,30.0
2982,Albert Bichot,"This has both a rich structure and rich fruit. The tannins comes first, dark and concentrated with spice and a dry core. After it, the ripe and juicy black fruit is layered with dense acidity. Together these two elements make for a concentrated wine that will age. Drink from 2020.",92,104.0
2983,Albert Bichot,"Ripe and juicy, this is a wine with structure and fine, dusty tannins that give it density. The red fruit is juicy, perfumed and has the freshness of the vintage, bright and forward. The underlying tannins are concentrated and will allow the wine to age. Drink from 2020.",92,80.0
2984,Albert Bichot,"This austere wine offers some firm tannins over the red fruit. It has acidity, red-currant fruit and a core of dryness, typical of young Pommard, that suggests it will age well. Drink from 2020.",92,130.0
2985,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"Crisp with an edge of honey, this is a ripe and fruity wine. Along with apple and cantaloupe melon flavors it has a nutty character and some light acidity, both of which add to its simple attraction. Drink now.",84,26.0
2986,Wines & Winemakers,"A fruity, young and crisp wine that is all about raspberry and red currant fruits. It is fresh with just a hint of caramel and with bright acidity at the end.",84,12.0
2987,Santa Ema,"This wine has such nice hickory, dried-spice and red-berry notes, it'd be a shame to drink it anywhere but outside on your deck, with some slow-cooked baby back ribs. Medium-weight, with some chalky tannins, it finishes with more of the same flavors, plus some char and green herb. Fire up the grill. Best Buy.",87,9.0
2988,Williams Selyem,"Made in a lighter style, but showing true Williams Selyem elegance and complexity. With pretty cherry, cola, spice and sandalwood flavors, it has bright acidity, and is a very nice Pinot Noir to drink now.",90,37.0
2989,Chehalem,"This wine's tangy raspberry and cherry fruit is front and center, with a vein of rich chocolate underneath. Dominated by acidity now, with oak and tannin components not fully integrated, it clearly needs more time to pull itself together and should reward further bottle age.",89,50.0
2990,Louis Jadot,"Light, fruity and juicy, this is a soft cherry-flavored wine. It has attractive acidity that lifts the warm fruitiness and gives the wine its characteristic perfumed aftertaste. Drink now.",86,14.0
2991,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"Pale onion skin in color, this is a soft fruity wine. It has attractive red-fruit flavors and light acidity. With a salty tang as well as some minerality, the wine is crisp and fruity right to the end.",86,12.0
2992,Siduri,"Shows the dark, extracted richness and full body of Pinot Noirs from this Monterey County appellation. The flavors of cherries, cola and mushu plum sauce are exceptionally powerful, almost sweet in the finish. Drink now, after a brief decant.",88,30.0
2993,Bründlmayer,"Sweet pure fruit, starring grapefruit flavors, is rounded with a more creamy character, and additional flavors of pear and fresh sliced melon, finished with pepper.",88,29.0
2994,Undurraga,"Opens on the scratchy side but settles into true Pinot country with some airing. Chunky and full in the mouth, with round berry flavors and leafy, herbal spice notes. Just juicy and fresh enough on the finish, with additional spice and some burn.",85,12.0
2995,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"Subtle smoke hovers above earthy notes and the nose only holds the faintest suggestion of citrus. The palate comes forth with a vivid, leafy purity that suggests herbs, freshly turned earth and pure, lifted citrus. All we get right now are the flavors hovering above the core which is still firmly closed. A wealth of apple and citrus fruit is evoked which will awake with time, this is too young to be opened. Don't touch before 2018 and then drink until 2030 or even beyond. This is dry, delicate and yet powerful with a supremely clean finish.",96,120.0
2996,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"The pure, delicate but ever so authentic scent of fragrant Muscat grapes rises from the glass. The palate is a joy: a feather-light, fragrant but intense experience of pure Muscat flavor. There is the textural tinge of lemon freshness and the uncompromising notion of stone on a dry, sprightly and utterly disarming palate of immense purity. What we are left with is a notion of fragrance and stone.",96,65.0
2997,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"Very faint notes of mandarine and earth emanate from this delicate, closed wine. All the flavors are subdued and delicate with flinty smoke making an appearance here and there. All of this suggests that this is far too young to be approached: the structure, however, suggests delicacy and balance, tender flavors of linearity and precision. Smoke and salt characterize the long finish. Drink 2019–2035.",96,100.0
2998,V. Sattui,"From a vineyard in Yountville, this wine has a voluptuous entry of baked peach and vanilla, with a back beat of tart key lime. Layered and lengthy, it offers flavor and body in abundance, ending fleshy and full.",92,27.0
2999,Iron Horse,"Light in color, Q is the winery's second vintage of a single-vineyard, single-clone expression of the variety. Concentrated in dark-cherry flavor, it's soft and silky on the palate, with an undercurrent of smoky oak and cedar.",92,85.0
3000,Georges Duboeuf,This fruity and juicy wine has red-berry flavors and fresh acidity. The fruit from this single vineyard gives concentration and some firm tannins as well as allowing a fresher side to sing out. Drink now.,86,15.0
3001,Georges Duboeuf,"This wine has considerable acidity and a crisp, raspberry flavor. A dry edge will need to soften to bring out its full, fruity potential. Drink from 2016.",86,20.0
3002,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"This is a splendid rendition of Chateau Ste. Michelle's mainstay Cabernet, rich and round, with a sophisticated mix of grapes, including Malbec, Cab Franc, Petit Verdot and Syrah. Dark fruit flavors of black cherry and cassis create a lush center, and the wine is more evolved and smoother, with less obvious oak and barrel flavor, than the pricier Cabs from Ste. Michelle.",90,16.0
3003,Feudi di San Gregorio,"This is a fascinating wine that represents the first bottling of a newly discovered grape called Sirica (only 690 bottles have been produced). Genetic research shows that the grape shares characteristic with Syrah but that its lineage extends deep into ancient times. The wine is simply delicious with soft layers of chocolate, cherry and spice and balanced firmness on the close. A great item for collectors.",94,
3004,V. Sattui,"The vineyard has been source of good Zinfandel for V. Sattui, and this is their best yet. The wine is enormously rich and ripe in berry, cherry, currant, mocha and pepper flavors, but its structure really warrants attention. Perfectly firm tannins, fine acidity, and a touch of minerality gives the wine grounding. The alcohol is high, but in keeping with the wine's expression.",93,40.0
3005,Feudi di San Gregorio,"The legend behind Pàtrimo is that the folks at Feudi di San Gregorio had misidentified the grape variety planted in their historic vineyard until it was finally confirmed to be Merlot. Very few vineyards with international varieties exist in this part of the world. This is a beautifully elegant but large expression with precise aromas of blackberry, spice, chocolate and maraschino cherry. The gorgeous 2007 vintage shows tannins that could still age in the cellar and a slightly sweet or chewy finish.",93,120.0
3006,Siduri,"Firm in tannins, mouthwatering in acids, and bone dry, this is a wine to hold for a while. The vineyard consistently yields rich, complex Pinots from various wineries, and Siduri again captures its essence as they have for many years. The wine, which is one of Siduri's ripest, shows wild forest cherry, raspberry, cola and spice flavors, with a feral quality suggesting grilled wild mushrooms and balsam. Give it 2–3 years.",93,48.0
3007,Columbia Crest,"This is an aromatically subdued wine with notes of peach, pineapple and spice. It's medium bodied, elegant in style with a lightly creamy feel, seeming a bit dilute.",86,15.0
3008,Louis Latour,"This wine is dark and structured, offering ripe fruits although they are covered at this stage by the tannins. Firm and dense, with a dry core, this will be a powerful wine full of black fruits and concentration. Drink this from 2023.",94,460.0
3009,Gary Farrell,"Smoothly seductive, this wine showcases an amazing site with great skill, coaxing high-toned squeezes of mandarin orange, honeysuckle and anise from a foundation of balance and acidity. Luxurious, the oak plays a supporting role, never distracting from a core of freshness and finesse.",94,60.0
3010,Louis Latour,"First recorded in 1375, this vineyard produces powerful, concentrated wines. This fine example is dense, weighty and firm. The acidity is there, buried in the firm tannins. It is a wine with an enormous potential, dark and full of plum skin and berries. Drink from 2022.",94,140.0
3011,Louis Latour,"Structured and dense, this wine comes from the remains of a quarry on the hill of Corton. From the Louis Latour domaine, it is powerful and packed with black fruits, rich while still with the freshness of the year. It has a good future, so don't drink before 2023.",94,150.0
3012,Chehalem,"Strong, dusty, stringy herbal notes run right through this wine, contributing to an overall impression of thin not-ripe-enough-for-prime-time fruit. Tart and hard, it's principally cranberries and bitter herbs, with a tannic finish. It helps to give it a lengthy decanting and/or aeration.",86,32.0
3013,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Orphelin is a real head-scratcher. A mutt wine blend of nine grapes, it might be trying to be Châteauneuf-du-WA except for the Cabernet, Petit Verdot, Pinot Noir and Touriga. Whatever, it comes together in a raisiny, broadly-built, unfocused red wine that could be fine on a picnic.",85,30.0
3014,Gary Farrell,"This 100% Zin erupts in briary, peppery wild raspberry, blueberry and cherry flavors. The tannins are firm, and the acids crisp and savory. What a lovely Zinfandel, made in the soft, velvety style of Merlot, but with Bradford Mountain power.",92,45.0
3015,Williams Selyem,"Shows the usual Williams Selyem Chardonnay profile of huge fruit and flashy oak. This opulent wine would be over-the-top except that it's balanced by crisp, lemony acidity, and somehow retains a tight core with a gravitational tug that keeps the richness focused. Impressive now for sheer power, and should hold well for another 5–6 years.",92,55.0
3016,Casa Santos Lima,"This fruity blend shows spice from oak aging and black-currant flavors. Soft and only lightly textured, it is a wine to drink young to benefit from the fruitiness.",85,10.0
3017,Montes,"This is opaque in color, with oaky, balsamic aromas of black fruits, mint and vanilla. In the mouth, this is muscular, with full and somewhat rough tannins. Toasty roasted blackberry flavors are peppery, minty and fully spiced, while on the finish this is packing all sorts of power and oak. Drink through 2021.",90,23.0
3018,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"The aromas are vibrant, with notes of pear, honeysuckle and peach. The palate is full flavored, dry as promised, with a zing of tart acidity that stitches it all together. It's an outstanding value that shows a beautiful sense of balance.",89,9.0
3019,Casa Santos Lima,"This is a ripe and lightly honeyed wine. It has an aromatic character that translates onto the palate in ripe mango, peach and apple flavors. There is a good texture, tangy and rich. Drink now.",88,
3020,V. Sattui,"Floral streaks of orange blossom open this wine, followed by vibrant bursts of lemon. Estate grown, produced and bottled, this fresh, balanced wine picks up weight on the finish, ending with a ripeness of voluptuous apple and oak.",88,29.0
3021,Wines & Winemakers,"Part of a range of wines that have been made to showcase the different styles of Portuguese regions, this wine brings out the fruitiness of Tejo. It's easy drinking, with soft tannins, attractive acidity and fresh blackberry flavors. Drink now.",88,11.0
3022,Wines & Winemakers,"Made from old vines, this is a fruity yet concentrated wine. It is rich and creamy, cut by sliced apple freshness. There is a typical Douro minerality that comes from the rocks of the region. Drink this wine from 2016.",88,12.0
3023,Louis Latour,"Rounded and ripe, this has yellow fruits along with a fresher, sliced apple character. The wine is fruity, perfumed and just touched by a more mineral texture, with crisp acidity that gives a ripe fruitiness. Drink from 2017.",88,
3024,Louis Latour,"This wine has a good structure both from ripe fruits and from rich texture. It is full in the mouth, given freshness with pear and apple acidity. Apricots go with a mineral edge that offers a fine texture. It's a wine to age until 2017.",88,
3025,Siduri,"A palate-pleasing combination of ripe plum and cherry fruit, gently applied baking spices, with a peppery bite and firm, focused tannins. Impeccable balance, with just enough ripeness to suggest ageworthiness.",90,39.0
3026,Testarossa,"In this appellation blend from the single-vineyard-focused Los Gatos winery, aromas of cherry and chaparral scrub are pleasant if reluctant to emerge. The palate laces tart pomegranate and cranberry with licorice and forest-floor elements.",88,45.0
3027,Louis Latour,"Produced in this village in the hills behind the main slope of the Côte de Beaune, this wine is smooth and rich. Fine, soft tannins easily integrate into the sweet texture and red-plum fruit. The acidity is there, giving a wine that is both fresh and generous. Drink from 2018.",88,45.0
3028,V. Sattui,"Right out of the bottle, this is tight, but airing coaxes out plenty of cherry, currant and tart persimmon flavors, with a pretty mouthfeel. Give this some time in the decanter to breathe and mellow.",88,39.0
3029,Georges Duboeuf,"Full bodied and very round in character, this has rich pineapple and white fruits that are cut with grapefruit-like acidity. A touch of spice surfaces from having been wood aged. This could age for 2–3 years.",88,
3030,Chanson Père et Fils,"A foursquare, solid wine that shows its structure right up front. It is backed by red fruits and acids that lend a warm feeling. Full and dense, this needs to age.",88,68.0
3031,Montes,"This Cabernet is topped with a coating of char and oak. Creamy and resiny in feel, this is a sticky, confected wine, with flavors of vanilla, resiny spice and berry fruits backed by lactic oak on the finish.",84,13.0
3032,Montes,"A thick slathering of oak gives this Malbec a plastic-like coating on the nose; in addition, there are aromas of brushy, herbal berry fruits. This is chunky and plump in feel, with herbal, oaky, minty flavors that outweigh the wine's berry character. The finish is hot and oaky.",84,13.0
3033,Maryhill,"Spice, pepper, chocolate and a hint of stem are all wrapped into this light-hearted Cabernet Franc. The pretty, sweet, cherry candy core gives it immediate appeal. Drink up.",86,17.0
3034,Maryhill,"Forward and pleasant, with a balanced attack of berry and peppery herb, this saw 20 months in one-fifth new French oak. The resulting toasty, lightly-chocolaty finish is pleasing, though it tends to override the subtle fruit. Drink soon.",86,25.0
3035,Santa Ema,"Boasts a reasonably complex bouquet of chocolate, cedar and weedy cassis, followed by a mellow, soft palate impression. The fruit is sweet and direct, just the kind of thing that would hit the spot with an impromptu meal of steak frites. No, there's not a lot of structure, but why age a wine that's so clearly made for immediate gratification?",86,9.0
3036,Undurraga,"Jammy, soft and juicy, this Cabernet Sauvignon tastes almost like a California field blend. But that's not bad, if not particularly varietally focused. Easy, very drinkable, it's a kind of “Cab-jolais” that can work as a bar pour or party wine.",85,7.0
3037,Concha y Toro,"Richly fruity and soft, this wine boasts loads of black-cherry and plum flavors. Clearly made from very ripe fruit, it lacks the herbaceous-vegetal character so often found in Merlot, but also any sense of structure. Finishes with a bit of alcoholic heat.",85,8.0
3038,Undurraga,"With its nose offering toasty oak and leather notes, this shows a bit of depth. Light but full-flavored, as Pinot may be, the dark cherry and oak flavors are simple and rustic.",84,12.0
3039,Concha y Toro,"Ripe pear-pineapple fruit is layered with vanilla and tinged with citrus. This is a plump, slightly heavy Chard best served cold at parties and picnics.",84,8.0
3040,Siduri,"A bit less intense aromatically than other Adam Lee bottlings, this shows sour plum, smoked meat and a touch of garden herbs on the nose. Those elements come alive on the palate, where peppercorns, oregano, thyme and pencil lead decorate dark cranberry fruits.",90,49.0
3041,Fess Parker,"Cherry-rhubarb juice, shiitake mushrooms, sagebrush and iron make for a lush and layered nose on this appellation-blend wine that is widely available. The palate begins with plush red cherry then dives into oregano, sage and mace spice. It's expertly complex for a reasonably priced wine.",90,30.0
3042,Siduri,"Soft and direct, this Pinot Noir offers easy flavors of cherries, currants, cola and spice, wrapped into a silky texture. Drink now.",86,30.0
3043,Louis Latour,"This is a delicious wine with fresh fruits that are crisply embedded in balanced acidity, melon and orange zest flavors. The wine has structure, minerality and a tight texture that contrasts with all this fruitiness. The finish is intense with acidity. Although the wine could be drunk now, it will be better from 2018.",93,
3044,Fess Parker,"There's a sharp element of lime rind and brie cheese skin at first sniff of this wine, but the nose quickly softens into white peach elements. Once sipped, the citrus pith tightness remains, and while it doesn't veer into juicy ripeness, there are supple apple and pear fruit flavors, cut further with lemon juice on the finish.",93,37.0
3045,Fess Parker,"There's a touch of soft cheese rind at first on the nose of this wine from the historic vineyard. It quickly emerges into a gray slate and white rock minerality, followed by warmed pears and apples. It's tightly focused on the steely, tense palate, with lime sorbet and green pear ripeness and a sunny body.",93,37.0
3046,Louis Latour,"Conveying a sense of richness, this is a smooth and creamy wine with a tannic structure that emerges out of the ripe apple and pear flavors. Acidity at the end is already well integrated into the crisp texture with its touch of orange zest and minerality. Drink from 2018.",93,
3047,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"This is a starkly mineral wine, with straightforward apple aromas followed by a crisp, bright palate infused with notes of beer nuts. Finishes light and dry, with a final accent of lemon peel.",88,64.0
3048,Georges Duboeuf,"The long slope of the Côte du Py has produced this structured wine that's firm, dry, tannic and needing to age. It is concentrated in both structure and in rich black-plum fruits. The wine will age well, so don't drink before 2017.",90,22.0
3049,Georges Duboeuf,"The bright cherry-red color shows how young this wine is. It is firm, still full of its youthful tannic character. Dense and solid, it has great juicy acidity, layers of red berries with more weight coming from dark plum flavors. It needs aging; drink from 2017.",90,25.0
3050,Georges Duboeuf,"Ths wine has firm tannins although these are well balanced by ample fruits and rich red-cherry flavors. It's a big wine, bold with fruit as well as tannins, a generous texture that just needs some time. Drink from 2017.",90,17.0
3051,Concha y Toro,"The hot conditions of 2009 are draped all over this rich, syrupy wine that's opaque to the eye and heavily charred on the nose. Under a blanket of burnt oak, there's leather, beef and black-fruit aromas. The palate on this heavyweight is chewy, while flavors of oak, roasted berry and herbs lead to a mildly complex but forceful finish. This is more big and ripe than elegant.",90,150.0
3052,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"A strong contender for the best $22 Merlot in the country. Sculpted, dense and deeply layered, it's loaded with mixed blue and black fruits, fresh herb and sweet toast. The use of new oak is restrained and appropriate, extending the finish with nicely applied streaks of coffee around ripe, tight, dry tannins.",91,22.0
3053,Bründlmayer,"Fresh but creamy notes of ripe Conference pear on the nose mute into a peppery, herbal, yeast-savory palate with verve and freshness of utter typicity. This is textbook Grüner that offers the full and perfect package of spice, freshness and fruit on a light but concentrated body. The finish is both long and clean.",93,32.0
3054,Bründlmayer,"Soft hints of orange zest on the nose give way to joyous, bright and sprightly lemon zest notes on the slender but concentrated palate. Lustrous citrus is expressed with great purity and drive. Freshness and verve is all. What a joy. You feel purified after drinking it. Drink 2016–2026 at least.",93,21.0
3055,Montes,"Cherry and lactic aromas give this a forced, pushy nose. Reasonable freshness and flavors of cherry, plum and minty oak are adequate, while the finish is scratchy and hot, with peppery spice and leftover oak.",85,16.0
3056,Casa Santos Lima,"The name, Al-Ria, at the seaside, is a reflection of the importance of the beach culture to this region. The wine has a cool, minty character although its black fruits are ripe and full. It is rich with berry flavors, warm tannins and a dry firm aftertaste. Drink now although the wine will soften.",88,15.0
3057,Louis Latour,"From the Louis Latour domaine, this rich wine is lightly touched with wood. It has red-plum flavors and ripe acidity, with the structure embedded in the fruits. Drink from 2019.",88,80.0
3058,Louis Latour,"Ripe and fruity with a velvet texture that encompasses the tannins easily, this is a rounded, rich wine. The balance of fruit and acidity is already attractive. Drink from 2018.",88,50.0
3059,DFJ Vinhos,"The wine tastes young, its fruits and wood characters not quite integrated. But it has a good light touch of redcurrants and blackberries to go with the acidity. The wood gives dry tannins and a firm structure.",84,8.0
3060,DFJ Vinhos,"A lively, crisp wine, packed with bright raspberries, red cherries and acidity. It has a touch of caramel, but no more. The freshness is much more important. Screwcap.",84,6.0
3061,Kunde,"Kunde's Reserve is all about the oak—rich buttered toast, caramel and butterscotch flavors. It overshadows the underlying fruit, but makes for a decadently pleasant sip.",85,35.0
3062,Robert Mondavi,"Fruity in black plum and ripe raspberry, it's structured and weighty on the palate, dark and brambly with firm, substantial tannins. The grapes come from both Rancho Carneros and the mighty Hyde Vineyard, both sites planted to relatively older vines, which show through in this wine's savory side.",90,60.0
3063,Testarossa,"From single vineyard specialist Testarossa, this has fresh aromas of raspberry and a bit of eucalyptus. The flavors are very straightforward and pleasant, with cherry dominating. Dill, oregano and thyme provide herbal backbone.",90,58.0
3064,Kendall-Jackson,"Scents of lemon-cake icing meet the pretty yet not treacly tropical aromatics of white flowers on this barely off-dry wine. The sweetness is noticeable on the palate but far from overdone, with clean flavors of lemon custard, tangerine juice and a Key-lime finish.",87,13.0
3065,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"There's immediate appeal to this wine's plum and cocoa aromas, with Syrah (11%) adding game and smoke. The flavors are fruit-forward with plenty of plushness that make it hard to resist. It doesn't seem entirely varietally correct but after the second sip all that is forgotten.",89,15.0
3066,Chehalem,"This is a delicious, tongue-tickling wine, crisp and solidly built with fresh fruit flavors of apple, lime and tangerine in abundance. Beyond that there is body and depth, with the fresh acidity that supports a great variety of lighter seafood, shellfish and poultry.",91,24.0
3067,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Creamy, fresh and delicately scented, this lovely sparkler opens with a fragrance of pressed yellow flowers, mango and a hint of flint. The elegantly structured palate offers nectarine zest, white peach, mineral and a honeyed note are accompanied by bright acidity.",91,43.0
3068,Williams Selyem,"The winery's third vintage from this cooler-climate vineyard offers a mix of bright red cherry, wild, dried herb, rose and anise aromas rising to the fore. Lingering acidity keeps the firm tannins at bay—the two opposites finding a peaceful balance, allowing a freshness of citrus to succulently creep in on the finish.",94,58.0
3069,Undurraga,"Tropical aromas come with familiar notes of apple and pear. This feels chunky and melony, with soft, pithy melon and apple flavors. It remains soft and friendly on the finish, and with more fruit than cut, it should be drunk right away.",87,13.0
3070,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"The aromas are firm and appealing, a good mix of black cherry and black currant, with a hint of garden soil. The mouthfeel is young and still taut, showing raspberry along with cherry fruit, and some stiff but well-managed tannins.",87,16.0
3071,Fess Parker,"Judged as medium-sweet on the international scale, this shows petrol and lime Jell-o on the nose. The palate is not overly sweet but certainly not dry, offering honeyed lemon curds and sugared lime-peel flavors.",88,15.0
3072,Fess Parker,"A touch of vanilla, butter and seared lemons characterize the nose of this wine that also shows pears and apples, making it a solid Chardonnay alternative. The palate offers a hint of marzipan along with juicy lemon pulp and zest as well as richer stone-fruit elements in the midpalate.",88,28.0
3073,Iron Horse,"Sharp in acidity while silky on the palate, this blend of 12 estate blocks is the Pinot made in the largest quantity by the winery. Soft, pretty and approachable, it offers red cherry, blackberry, rose petal and cola spice, with a bite of oak on the finish.",88,50.0
3074,Trapiche,"This is a real blaster of a Malbec, showing power, concentration and subtleties. The bouquet is full of graham cracker, cola, monster berry and moss notes, while the pure, driving palate deals flavors of toasty blackberry, spice, mocha and more. The lengthy but mellow finish hums like a fine-tuned machine. Drink now–2018.",95,50.0
3075,Trapiche,"This smells as deep as an ocean trench, with mint, cola, blackberry and toast aromas all rolled into a tight bomb that's ready to explode. It feels balanced yet densely concentrated, with wild berry, tobacco, savory spice and even a mild saucy component. This finishes smooth, with integrated leather, herb and berry flavors. Drink any time over the next 5–6 years.",94,50.0
3076,Trapiche,"Brambly smelling, with tomato, green herb and rhubarb aromas. Nervy and tight in the mouth, with minty, spicy flavors that keep any fruit character in the distance. Scratchy and tannic as well.",83,10.0
3077,Undurraga,"Leesy stone-fruit aromas start out tight and crisp but lose clarity and cleanliness as this warms up in the glass. A lean, fresh palate holds flavors of barely ripe stone fruits and dried apricot that run long on a finish with bitter notes of grape skins.",88,30.0
3078,Wines & Winemakers,"While still light, this Vinho Verde has a creamy texture and a sense of richness. It blends two of the quality grapes of the region, Alvarinho and Loureiro. Together they make an aromatic, intense and tangy wine that is ready to drink.",90,14.0
3079,Casa Santos Lima,"An unusual blend of Touriga Nacional and Petit Verdot, this wine does in fact work. Tannins, perfume and a dense, dark color give weight and concentration. It is a powerful wine with a future. Drink from 2019.",90,25.0
3080,Chehalem,"With its mix of citrus, stone and tropical fruits, this appealing wine is just a touch past bone-dry. Sourced entirely from estate vineyards, it's supported by just the right amount of acidity. Drink through 2020.",90,20.0
3081,Kendall-Jackson,"Clean and crisp, with classic flavors of lemons, limes and gooseberries, softened with a touch of buttercream and vanilla. The finish is fine and has a touch of sweet honeysuckle. A good value.",88,12.0
3082,Undurraga,"Undurraga's top Sauvignon hails from the premier terroir of Leyda. It smells clean and inviting, with an aromatic mix of talcum powder, lime, mango and scallion. The palate is very fresh and lively, with snappy citrus flavors that include grapefruit. Razor-clean on the finish.",89,22.0
3083,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"At this stage, this wine still shows considerable wood flavors. As it develops, its rich pear and peach fruit will come more to the fore along with the crisp edge of acidity and citrus. The texture, with its mineral edge, will allow this single-parcel wine to develop well. Drink from 2018.",92,69.0
3084,Foxen,"Some will criticize this Chardonnay for being too oaky and sweet, but it sure is delicious. It just brims with pineapple, yellow apricot, crème brûlée, honey and buttered toast flavors that are balanced with crisp acidity. If you like that California style, you'll love this opulent wine.",90,32.0
3085,Kunde,"Tropical and fleshy with upfront acidity, this wine has a full-bodied richness on the nose and overtone, despite a more light-bodied midpalate and finish. Along the way, lemony brightness mingles with a taste of yellow apple.",88,18.0
3086,Lynmar,"This vineyard designate is consistently richer and rounder than many of the other whites made by the producer, a mix of thick and concentrated barrel influence and savory-sweet fruit and spice. Full bodied, it offers a curiously compelling briny edge, decadent yet bright.",93,55.0
3087,Albert Bichot,"There is a fine steely, mineral character to the wine that parallels the ripe yellow fruit, toast and quince jelly flavors. The ensemble is rich, but maintains the true cool-climate character of Chablis.",93,
3088,Albert Bichot,"Plenty of ripe fruit and big texture on this intense wine, which hasn't shown half its potential yet. The pear and white peach fruits are edged with minerality and a closed-in texture. The wood gives an unfortunate burnt edge that needs to soften out. Age for at least five years.",93,
3089,Siduri,"A rich, candied Pinot Noir, filled with raspberry, cherry and mocha flavors. It's a bit simple, but deliciously so, with a crisply silky texture.",87,30.0
3090,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"A new offering from the country's largest producer of Rieslings, this fits an emerging off-dry category, with 11% alcohol and 4.7% residual sugar. It's a slightly sweeter companion to the winery's popular Columbia Valley bottling, with more of the honey and tea, less of the cool fruit flavors.",87,9.0
3091,Wines & Winemakers,"The blend of Fernão Pires and Arinto produces a rich and creamy wine with pear, ripe apple and apricot flavors. A floral character gives extra piquancy.",87,12.0
3092,Kendall-Jackson,"KJ's Mendocino County Zin has both red and black berry fruit flavor and the spiciness one expects from dry-farmed Mendocino County vineyards, though the tannins stick around a bit longer than one might like. Cedar definitely shows up on the finish.",87,16.0
3093,Kunde,"Front-loaded with sweet blackberry, cherry and currant fruit, this Cabernet has some firm tannins that will play well against steak. Ready to drink now.",86,23.0
3094,Montes,"Floral-smelling up front, this lightweight, cool-climate Pinot offers tutti-frutti raspberry aromas in front of a crisp, lean palate. Dry, spicy, oaky flavors dominate a beam of modest red currant and cherry notes, while the finish is light and hollows out quickly.",86,25.0
3095,Montes,"Blackberry and cassis aromas come with oak-based notes of pencil eraser and plastic. This blend is mildly sharp and acidic in feel, with sinewy tannins. Blackberry, currant, coconut and vanilla flavors finish solid but don't evolve or improve.",86,15.0
3096,Fess Parker,"This clonal study blends rich black cherry and sassafras notes with cola, savory herbs, strong iron and slight scorched rubber aromas. The palate jumps from a red cherry and cranberry tartness right into a toasted sage and pencil-lead character.",87,55.0
3097,Kunde,"Made from vines well over 100 years old on the Kunde Estate, this wine is tight and youthful in dry, dusty and grippy tannin, with thick, extracted flavors of red berry and cherry. A streak of pencil lead and fig provides further intrigue and complexity around a full-bodied elegance.",87,50.0
3098,Santa Ema,"Sure, cedar and chocolate are the dominant aromas and flavors, but there's enough blueberry fruit to stand up to the oak rather nicely. It doesn't hurt that the oak is high-quality stuff either, as the elements blend together in a harmonious whole. A little oaky, but shows a degree of finesse not often found in Chilean wines at this level.",87,14.0
3099,Concha y Toro,"Concha y Toro is making an effort to upgrade its entire lineup. This offering boasts copious weedy, chocolaty, black-currant aromas, followed by a soft, lush mouthfeel. It could use a bit more backbone, but this is a generously fruity wine ideal for early consumption.",87,29.0
3100,Kunde,"From older vines on the producer's estate, this wine has a depth of richness to the nose and is intensely powerful in gingerbread and Meyer lemon on the medium-bodied palate. Lemony acidity rounds out the finish, flecked in butter.",90,45.0
3101,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"Smoke, orange, wet stone and earth notes are powerful and beguiling on the nose. The palate has absolute concentration and energy and more of that smoky promise. This is like the bundled focus of a laser light—incisive, precise and piercing. Notions of peach, lemon and tangerine dance and hover, but the central core and force remains a kind of drive that could move mountains. This is a sleeping giant, absolute and pure, brooding, laying in wait to unleash its might. The palate is absolutely dry, absolutely fresh, absolutely uncompromising. The finish is piercingly clean. Wait for this. Drink 2025–2040 at least.",97,120.0
3102,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"A touch of flinty reduction still hangs over the nose, subduing the varietal aromas. But this is only a sign of youth, as is the residual carbon dioxide on the palate. While very young, this holds all it needs for a promising future: A bright core of juicy fruit—think tangerine, tart red apple and ripe yellow pear—as well as the vividly clean and racy freshness of bright lemon. This is concentrated and rather powerful, rapier-like in its cleansing, dry finish but also generous on its fruity midpalate. This is confident and self-assured and stands tall with its powerful structure and body. Leave this to calm down and become itself. Drink 2018–2037.",96,100.0
3103,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"Soft and round, this ripe wine offers both fruit and acidity. It is young and full of green plum and pear flavors, still textured with a young, crisp character. It needs to fill out for a few years, and will be best from 2017.",89,43.0
3104,Georges Duboeuf,"Tannins, acidity, black fruit, everything is in its right place in this wine. It has the structure of the vintage, with a series of dry, smoky bacon flavors, the weight apparent.",89,15.0
3105,Georges Duboeuf,"Warm and ripe wine, very open with its red fruit acidity well integrated. There are tannins and a more dry character of course—this is a 2010 wine, but the main effect is of weight and some power.",89,19.0
3106,DFJ Vinhos,"Two complementary grapes produce this ripe wine that's full of citrus flavors and balanced with pear and peach. It's rounded and rich in its texture, with a touch of honey to go with the lemon acidity on the finish.",87,9.0
3107,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"There's immediate appeal to this wine's plum and cocoa aromas, with Syrah (11%) adding game and smoke. The flavors are fruit-forward with plenty of plushness that make it hard to resist. It doesn't seem entirely varietally correct but after the second sip all that is forgotten.",89,15.0
3108,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Though the oak is high quality (62% new American and French), it's in your face on this 100% varietal wine, with notes of char and toast. It's soft, silky and elegant in feel but the barrel flavors take over making it hard to get all the fruit notes.",87,26.0
3109,Columbia Crest,"This is a new offering for Columbia Crest's Grand Estates lineup. Fresh fruit flavors emphasize lemon, lime and pineapple, backed with moderate acidity. A nice spicy lift informs the finish. Light and lively.",87,12.0
3110,Santa Ema,"With heavy notes of botrytis and oak, this is reflective of the European style of sweet whites. The palate is fleshy but not terribly precise, while flavors of caramel, butter and baked apple finish modest and shy on acidity.",87,
3111,Lynmar,"Flinty lemon and caramel are flouted around rich layers of caramel and baked quince in this blend of two vineyard sites, both planted to Wente selection Chardonnay. The richness of the vineyards speaks loudly enough to call for only neutral oak to be used in aging. The finish brings a spark of pineapple and mango custard.",93,70.0
3112,Testarossa,"An oily character of tangerine skin, peach flesh and condensed nuts meets with caramel, pinched soda and cut stone-fruit freshness on the nose of this top bottling from the Los Gatos producer. The palate shows ripe Granny Smith apple flesh, seared pears and almond oil, with a sea-salt splash on the finish.",93,70.0
3113,Testarossa,"The fantastic nose pitches French toast together with Meyer lemon pith, crushed rock, struck match and a slight sour-cream element. This wine is immediately lively on the tongue, with lots of but not overdone acidity. Yeasty toast flavors are cut by lemon and poached pear on a racy and focused palate.",93,48.0
3114,Santa Ema,"A recommended Chardonnay that's a step or two up from this country's norm. Vanilla, toast and apple aromas set the stage for lively apple, peach and melon flavors. Honey and toast work the finish, and overall it blends tropical power and sweetness with subtleties and some elegance.",88,14.0
3115,Testarossa,"The most accessible of Testarossa's 2008 Pinot Noirs, this blend is dry and silky and fruity. Rewards for its plethora of cherry, raspberry, cola, cinnamon, white pepper and sandalwood flavors. Drink now–2011.",88,37.0
3116,Testarossa,"A leesy, young wine, with the slightly sour, creamy richness of sur lie aging. A peacock's tail of tropical and citrus fruits and pears is brightened by crisp acidity and sweetened by toasty oak. Rich and complex; drink now and over the next three years.",92,39.0
3117,DFJ Vinhos,Ripe red fruits dominate this soft and juicy wine. The light structure and touch of tannin give shape to this easy wine. Drink now.,84,10.0
3118,Wines & Winemakers,"Moscatel in the blend of this wine gives it a perfumed character. The wine is soft, gently ripe and with pleasing acidity. It is ready to drink.",84,11.0
3119,Wines & Winemakers,"Produced from old vines, this is a crisp, bright wine. Its caramel and perfumes give it an exotic edge while acidity keeps everything lively. It is ready to drink.",84,14.0
3120,Testarossa,"With overripe flavors, this Pinot is extremely atypical of Testarossa's normally balanced wines. It has a raisin skin bitterness that won't age away.",82,54.0
3121,Testarossa,"Broad aromas of seared lemons, white peach and nectarine are given nuance with a bit of quinine on this entry-level bottling. Stewed lemons and apple-custard flavors show on the plush and pillowy palate, cut with an acidic sizzle.",88,23.0
3122,V. Sattui,"This high-end Cab is named after a deceased winery employee who would be pleased to have such a distinguished wine in his memory. It's very powerful and tannic and needs age, but it's also exceptionally balanced. Showing ripe red and black currant flavors that have been generously oaked, it's a gorgeous young Napa Valley Cab that should develop through 2014.",93,95.0
3123,Albert Bichot,"Deliciously rich and fruity, this is a wine that shows that Clos de Vougeot is a great vineyard. It has all the ripeness, the big, generous fruit, supported by wood. The berry flavors are intense, pierced through with acidity, and the denseness of the wine promises good aging.",93,
3124,Lynmar,"This is just too young to drink now. The interplay of the acids and tannins locks down the flavors and make a sting on the palate. But there is the terrific core of flavor, of ripe blackberries and cherries, of red and black currants, of cola and root beer and licorice, that will emerge in time, making for delicious drinking. Best 2009–2013, possibly longer.",93,60.0
3125,Robert Mondavi,"One of the ripest, highest alcohol Mondavi Reserve Cabs in memory, this wine is forward in cassis and cherry flavors, and while the tannins are pretty sturdy, it's sweet and soft enough to drink now. It definitely has the rich mouthfeel you want in a pricey Napa Cab. But it's young; cellar this one until at least 2010.",92,125.0
3126,Williams Selyem,"It's easy for a California Chardonnay to be rich, but few can rise to the level of balanced complexity as this gorgeous bottling. The wine is enormous in apricot, orange, nectarine, pear and Meyer lemon fruit, with the vanilla and buttered toast of French oak. The acidity is just about perfect.",94,55.0
3127,Testarossa,"This single-vineyard exploration shows a more tropical side than the winery's other Chardonnays. Rich, rounded notes of honeysuckle, lemon custard and apple cider characterize the nose. The palate is reserved compared to the showy aromas, with buttered peach and green-apple flavors.",90,48.0
3128,Williams Selyem,"This is deep and ruby in hue, while the aromas are spicy, brightly oaky and reminiscent of red cherries. Ripe yet fresh and tangy flavors recall cherries and raspberries, while a vein of darker plum comes in and lingers on the long finish. It's serious and delightful at the same time, and will age well; delicious now, but best after 2016.",93,58.0
3129,Robert Mondavi,"Toast with apricot jam comes first to mind in this nicely balanced white that begins in richness and evolves in the glass to offer a freshness of lime zest and grapefruit, the minerality well-defined.",90,55.0
3130,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"Towards the southern end of Chassagne, Morgeot is a large premier cru that once belonged to an abbey. This wine is full of fruit, spiced with the wood aging and with a strongly mineral texture. It has the potential to be rich, round and smooth. Wait until 2018.",92,180.0
3131,Louis Latour,"This is a ripe and fruity wine. Soft, generous tannins are embedded in the developing red-fruit flavors. With spice, hints of the wood aging and a rich texture, the wine will develop relatively quickly. Drink from 2020.",92,350.0
3132,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"This white has a touch of everything desirable. The nose is perfectly structured and classic, with bright stone fruits, white flowers and mineral underlined by a hint of ginger. Spices, lemon, peach and pear fruit come through in the mouth,and persist nicely on the long finish. This flavorful wine calls for flavorful food; think ceviche. Drink now or hold five-plus years for more complexity.",91,48.0
3133,Albert Bichot,"A ripe, open style of wine, giving white fruits, even some peach flavors, with toast and sweetness. There is weight, and a dense texture as well, the acidity lifting the finish.",91,
3134,Trapiche,"A very rich and soft wine made from hand-squeezed Malbec grapes. There's a ton of oak on it, which comes out as coconut and cream on the nose. The palate is also creamy, with mocha, sweet blackberry and fudge flavors. Cola, coconut, coffee and other hedonistic, dark, masculine accents make this a fun and interesting wine to drink now. Best on its own or with meat.",91,90.0
3135,Bründlmayer,"Spiced fruit, creamed apples and some ripe tangy character all work together to give a bright, peppery wine, delicious now but worth aging for 1–2 years. The wine has great intensity, but seems to float easily between the fruit and the taut ageworthy character. Screwcap.",91,
3136,Bründlmayer,"A funky yeasty richness still lingers on this very young wine, the palate, however, shows all the promise of a concentrated yet refreshing wine: there is ripe, juicy pear flesh at the core, framed by zesty lime that swings with the peppery freshness of arugula and watercress. This is full of life, concentration, charm and refreshment.",93,22.0
3137,Chanson Père et Fils,"An enticing mix of toast and white fruit aromas follows through to rich apricot and ripe pear flavors, spiced with the creamy toast. The wood does need to calm down for the wine to be at its best.",93,100.0
3138,Louis Latour,"An intense and concentrated wine, with dense black fruits balanced by acidity. There is ripeness here, with a firm, ageworthy structure as well as delicious juicy Pinot Noir character.",93,129.0
3139,Robert Mondavi,"A lovely young Cab, rich and balanced, and with the elegance you expect from this producer. Made from all 5 Bordeaux varieties, with a drop of Syrah, the wine is potent in red and black currant, blackberry and new oak flavors, with sweetly ripe tannins. Delicious now, it should develop through 2015.",91,28.0
3140,Concha y Toro,"Some of the best-bred Carmenères in the world are grown in Peumo, and a star example is this saturated, minty wine with medium-weight tannins and a long finish. It's lush, powerful and along the way you taste pepper, chocolate, berries and sunshine.",91,36.0
3141,Louis Jadot,"Packed with tannins and boasting an enormous structure, this wine is opulent while very firm. At the same time, smoky acidity shoots through all this density. From a great terroir, this wine shows minerality and its great structure well. Drink from 2023.",97,288.0
3142,Louis Jadot,"This wine is perfumed with gorgeous fruit that contrasts with the strict minerality. The tannins under the fruit are severe, solid, dark and promising enormous potential. Concentrated even while it celebrates great fruit, it is going to last for many years. Drink from 2023.",97,468.0
3143,Gary Farrell,"This might be one of the best values on the market, given the quality. Equal parts pretty and funky, it's a tightly wound, savory, fruity wine that's elegant and compelling. The tannins and oak are lightly imprinted around strawberry-rhubarb and fresh-cut rose, and the texture seductively silky. This is a delicious treat of a wine that should also age.",95,45.0
3144,Williams Selyem,"Ferrington is one of Anderson Valley's greatest vineyards, and this wine is stunning. Fully dry and elegant in structure, with fine acidity and dusty tannins, it offers a wealth of cola, cherry pie, mushu plum sauce, cinnamon and cardamom spice flavors. Will easily develop over the next eight years.",94,62.0
3145,Williams Selyem,"Rich in fine, pure tannins, this Pinot is delicious now, but has the structure to age. It shows ripe wild black cherry, currant, mocha, anise and spice flavors that finish with a smoky, oaky sweetness. Best now for its approachability, and over the next few years.",93,72.0
3146,Williams Selyem,"This is one of the winery's more elegant, sensual wines. What it does not possess in sheer power it more than makes up for in hedonistic delight. Racy and silky, it excites the palate with intricate layers of black raspberry and cherry tart, cola, Asian spices and smoky oak. The finish goes on and on and on.",93,54.0
3147,Gary Farrell,"Despite a silky, medium-bodied texture, this Pinot is tough and tannic, with a sandpapery astringency through the finish. It's deep in flavor, with waves of cherry, cola, rhubarb, pomegranate, balsam, mushroom and sandalwood, and is elegantly structured and thoroughly dry. Needs time. Better after 2011.",93,65.0
3148,Lynmar,"A beautiful, soft and likeable Pinot Noir, with considerable complexity. Shows waves of black cherries, red currants, cola, mocha, bacon, licorice and sandalwood flavors that finish in a swirl of dusty spices. Dry and silky, this Pinot is drinking well now, and should hold over the next six years.",93,60.0
3149,Siduri,"Tart and bright, with pretty cherry candy fruit flavor, this crisply defined Pinot Noir is annotated with rosemary, thyme and pepper. There's even a hint of pine needle—it's definitely Oregon, not California fruit—but well-made with good structure.",87,20.0
3150,DFJ Vinhos,"Rounded, soft creamy wine, attractively fruity with yellow fruits and bright acidity. It's easy, the freshness naturally integrated with the soft fruit. Screwcap.",85,6.0
3151,Foxen,"Vigorous in body, this Syrah comes from one of Foxen's warmest vineyards, the well-known Vogelzang. It's riper and higher in alcohol than their Tinaquaic Syrah, making it richer, rounder and tastier. With blackberry, orange peel, red licorice and cola flavors, it's balanced with fine tannins and acidity. Drink now–2017.",92,44.0
3152,Bründlmayer,"An intensely acidic wine, its tannins and spice acting as a foil to the freshest of black currant fruit flavors. It's definitely a cool-climate red. Screwcap.",86,
3153,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"With fruit drawn from all over Burgundy, this is a light, bright and refreshing wine. It has light acidity, spice and apple flavors and a bright, tight aftertaste. Drink now.",85,23.0
3154,Wines & Winemakers,"A blend of Viosinho and Verdelho, this a soft and ripe wine that has attractive pear, melon and gentle acidity. A light perfume from the Verdelho adds to the attractiveness of this fruity wine. It is ready to drink.",85,13.0
3155,Montes,"Angular and piquant on the nose, with tight aromas of red zinger tea, fresh herbs and raspberry. This is a Pinot made in a light, coastal style; it offers red cherry, cough drop and tea-like flavors in front of a lasting, unforced but mild finish. A year in French oak has added a buttery element, and overall the wine rings true but distant.",86,24.0
3156,Santa Ema,"A bit of volatility and jamminess is acceptable here because overall the wine is good. The nose mixes graphite and cassis with leather and earth to give a sense of good things to come, while the palate is snappy and properly tannic, with nice black cherry, plum and chocolate flavors. Solid and sturdy; 60% Cabernet and 40% Merlot.",86,11.0
3157,Santa Ema,"Slightly oily and lemony on the nose, but there's also some sauvage character along with berry aromas. The palate can be best described as “juicy,” which means the acidity is fairly high and the extract level not all that thick. And with red berry and plum flavors in front of a short finish, this one is ready to drink now.",86,11.0
3158,Maryhill,"Coming from the cool 2011 vintage, this vineyard-designated wine doesn't seem entirely ripe, displaying notes of herbs, cranberry and red fruit. It's screamingly tart with moderate fruit flavors and abundant oak accents that lead to a warm finish.",85,32.0
3159,DFJ Vinhos,"This wine is an exemplary expression of Touriga Nacional. It has structure, perfumes, rich black-fruit flavors and a serious tannic background. Concentrated and with fine intensity, it needs to age, so drink from 2017.",91,15.0
3160,Foxen,"This bottling from fine winery Foxen has varied over the vintages, sometimes quite good, sometimes ordinary. The '11 is somewhere in the middle. It's a bit thin, with the blackberry, coffee and currant flavors disappearing quickly on the finish. It's also oddly acidic, whether naturally so or added. Either way, it's not an ager.",86,48.0
3161,Louis Latour,"This light, fresh wine, with its concentration on raspberry flavors, has lifted acidity and an edge of bitterness. The tannins are there, but relatively subdued, so it's likely to age quickly.",87,60.0
3162,Chehalem,"The slightly off-dry profile (12g/L residual sugar) perfectly complements the ultraripe, deeply concentrated fruit. It's downright plush, with ripe apple and pear tart flavors. Young as it is, you may not want to wait to drink this one.",92,29.0
3163,Columbia Crest,"This limited release (300 cases), first-ever Zin from Columbia Crest points to the rising prominence of this quintessentially Californian grape. In Washington's Wahluke Slope, Zin ripens well without turning into a Port-like substance. Tightly-defined raspberry, blackberry and plum fruits, scented with violets and juicy with fresh acid, take to the new oak aging well. It's a balanced mix of berry, barrel and crisp, palate-cleansing acid.",88,30.0
3164,Trapiche,Basic black-plum aromas are as good as it gets. This is showing too much acid and not nearly enough stuffing to support it. Scratchy pie cherry and raspberry flavors finish raw and rugged.,83,18.0
3165,Wines & Winemakers,"Lightly fizzy, this is a crisp, off-dry Vinho Verde. It has candied lemon flavors that are shot through with acidity, finishing bright and brisk. Drink now.",83,
3166,Casa Santos Lima,"A medium-sweet wine, with a light prickle on tongue, very much in the style of some Vinho Verde, this is crisp, with lemon candy flavors and bright acidity. Drink now.",83,10.0
3167,Iron Horse,"Made to benefit the exploratory organization, this high-toned stunner exudes flavors of Gravenstein apple followed by a slight richness of marzipan. Moderate acidity and weight makes it a fine companion for the table, finishing with a sense of welcome fullness.",92,50.0
3168,Chehalem,"Pretty milk chocolate wraps around fresh strawberry fruit in this estate-grown, single-vineyard selection. A gentle wine, it turns almost soft in the middle, finishing with delicate flavors of rose water.",89,50.0
3169,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Most of the fruit for this wine comes from the esteemed Cold Creek Vineyard. It brings an aromatic medley of plum, cocoa, vanilla, milk chocolate and spice. The flavors are plush in feel, barrel heavy, but still bringing plenty of appeal.",91,45.0
3170,Iron Horse,"From four acres at the crest of a knoll onsite, this wine is indelibly crisp in cranberry and orange. It's structured and classy, with a zesty acidity that belies the darker, deeper elements of toasted oak and Asian spice. The tannins are there, but subtle and supportive, resulting in a pretty yet substantive selection.",94,85.0
3171,Iron Horse,"A warmth of baking spices like cardamom and nutmeg charge an otherwise earthy, herbal wine. It's light bodied yet complex, crisp in strawberry and black cherry flavors. Only the third vintage produced from this particular site, it's subtly ripe and lengthy in texture.",94,85.0
3172,Trapiche,"Walnut and almond aromas share the bouquet with melon and apple scents. This feels fleshy and resiny, with a generic mix of white-fruit flavors and oak. A bulky, woody, creamy finish with tropical fruit flavors is kept afloat by firm acidity.",85,
3173,Trapiche,"Waxy aromas suggest haystack and dusty apple. This is on the borderline of heavy and cloying in the mouth, while oak is the main driver of the flavor profile. On the finish, notes of melon and banana are covered by a resiny oak flavor.",85,15.0
3174,Wines & Winemakers,"A solid and textured wine, Catapereiro Reserva is full-bodied and rich. With dark berry and ripe plum fruit characteristics, as well as firm tannins, it is a serious and complex wine that deserves aging. Drink from 2015.",89,19.0
3175,Bründlmayer,"A very light, almost rustic red that calls for hearty meals. A sonorous note of vanilla-oak amid the cherryish red fruit accompanies the streamlined acidity from start to finish.",89,18.0
3176,Fess Parker,"This nose from the actor-turned-vintner's family vineyard shows tight aromas of chalk, rain on cement and lime pith and blossoms. The laser-focused palate holds to the lime-pith lead, also showing ruby-red grapefruit juice, but exercising a lot of clean restraint.",91,36.0
3177,Wines & Winemakers,"This is a ripe and spicy wine that is full of dense black fruits. Tannins and spice from wood aging merge with the rich fruit, giving a dry core to the plump, generous wine. It can be drunk now, although the wine will be better from 2017.",91,15.0
3178,Undurraga,"Piercing aromas announce that this is no basic quaffer. The palate shows blazing acids that narrow everything down to citrus, lemon, underripe pineapple and Granny Smith apple flavors. While almost sour, it's not, with briney green fruit on a long, scouring finish.",88,20.0
3179,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"Mid-amber in color. Interesting nose showing bright citrus aromas, honey and hints of petrol. Tangy with blood orange, tangerine and orangeade flavors, that are a little one dimensional. Medium-bodied, fruity and easy-drinking. Medium length with a crisp citrus finish.",88,68.0
3180,Undurraga,"Petrol leads the nose, which also deals pear and melon in a solid facsimile of Alsace. The palate is lemony and cut by streaking acidity, while the flavors of citrus run tart and monotone. Finishes zesty, with green apple and lemon.",87,20.0
3181,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Coming from the warm 2013 vintage, this easy-drinking wine offers notes of sweet corn, pear and peach with light barrel accents. The fruit flavors are elegant with a lightly creamy feel.",87,11.0
3182,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"This is an aromatic wine with notes of rose water, pear and white flowers. It drinks medium sweet with abundant spice flavors throughout. Pair with spicy Thai dishes.",87,10.0
3183,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Coming from the cool 2011 vintage this wine offers a blue-fruit profile seldom seen in the state for this variety along with notes of chocolate and coffee. It's elegantly styled with a soft feel, trailing toward the finish.",87,28.0
3184,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"This wine offers aromatic notes of blueberry and barrel spices. It's smooth and easy-drinking, not offering much complexity but bringing plenty of appeal.",87,15.0
3185,Chehalem,"Beautifully Burgundian, this soft, elegant and refined reserve bottling captures pretty black cherry fruit, wraps it in a wreath of sandalwood and sassafras, and lingers temptingly through an extended finish. Delicious already, it has the structure to age for a decade or longer.",93,60.0
3186,Columbia Crest,"This wine starts out a bit reduced before it opens to display aromas of kiwi, pineapple and pink grapefruit. The flavors drink dry and seem quite dilute.",84,24.0
3187,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Coming from the cool 2011 vintage this wine offers a blue-fruit profile seldom seen in the state for this variety along with notes of chocolate and coffee. It's elegantly styled with a soft feel, trailing toward the finish.",87,28.0

3189,Testarossa,"Cooked cranberry scents are enlivened by turned earth, dewy sage and a touch of wildfire smoke in this bottling from the Los Gatos-based winery. Baked red-cherry flavors meet with a savory pork-au-jus-like element on the palate, redolent with roasted thyme and oregano. A licorice element rises toward the finish. It's mellow in intensity but with lots of depth.",93,64.0
3190,Albert Bichot,"Spice, especially nutmeg, is a distinctive character in this soft, ripe wine. It lacks some definition, but is attractively round. Fruit flavors tend toward white pears, edged with toast, while the texture is fat, full.",89,90.0
3191,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Part of a Limited Release series, this Syrah is made from fruit that was sourced from the Wahluke Slope, and it's co-fermented with 5% Viognier. Solid and substantial, it offers clear flavors of coffee, licorice, herb and earth, plus a deep, saturated note of blackberry syrup. A touch of dark chocolate infuses the finish.",90,30.0
3192,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Part of a Limited Release series, this supple, oaky Malbec includes Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. Made from Canoe Ridge Estate Vineyard fruit, this offers compelling blue- and black-fruit flavors that are wrapped in coffee and cream notes. It's a structured wine that can be cellared up to a decade.",90,25.0
3193,V. Sattui,"When it comes to sheer extracted power, Zinfandel doesn't get more massive than this. Several things come together. Zin's wild, briary flavors of currants and raisins are here with fantastic concentration, along with notes of licorice, bitter dark chocolate and exotic spices. Howell Mountain's famously hard tannins co-star. The alcohol is high and heady, and discloses itself with jalapeño pepper heat. Not for everyone, but a great evocation of its style.",91,42.0
3194,Columbia Crest,"Aromas of smoke, herb, barrel spice and dark fruit lead to medium-bodied, supple fruit flavors. It doesn't all seem to come together at present, with the wood seeming primary.",88,40.0
3195,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Give this gorgeous wine a few more years in the bottle so that the evident oak tones become tame and supple. You can count on the wine's aromas of cherry, blackberry and plum to carry it forward. At this young stage, however, those oak shadings are too evident and the wine is in its infancy. Drink after 2012.",91,87.0
3196,Gary Farrell,"A fine Chardonnay, marked by crisp, citrusy acidity that cleanses the mouth and makes the wine so refreshing. Flavorwise, it's a powerhouse, with pear, green apple, lemon meringue, buttered toast and smoky, vanilla flavors that finish in a swirl of cloves and pepper.",91,32.0
3197,Louis Latour,"Fat and full-bodied as befits a Meursault, but tempered with green acidity, the rich fruit of this wine is laced with wood, the fullness a shield for the crisp white fruits and steeliness.",91,
3198,Gary Farrell,"This multivineyard blend isn't cheap, but it's almost as good as Farrell's more expensive single-vineyard Pinots, which makes it kind of a value. Like them, it's a dry, crisply acidic wine, and slightly austere. It shows tobacco-infused cherry pie filling, pomegranate, rhubarb and cola flavors.",91,42.0
3199,Columbia Crest,"Light aromas of baking spice, vanilla and red fruit lead to well-balanced red-fruit and barrel flavors that taper toward the finish, with coffee flavors lingering.",87,15.0
3200,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"This Bordeaux blend has a different artist's label every year but otherwise has no identity of its own. This new release is tight, hot and shows signs of reduction; it's got a burnt rubber scent underlying the ultraripe, almost pruny fruit. It's just not a compelling wine; it hasn't jelled and it doesn't seem as if it will. There is concentration and power to be sure, but pleasure is in short supply.",85,48.0
3201,Gary Farrell,"Raspberry liqueur and orange-cranberry flavors combine effortlessly in this beautifully made, refined wine. It's bright in acidity while offering a dense body and youthful oak tones. Black tea, cola, plum and streaks of freshly tilled earth make it memorable on the palate, accented by rose petals and cranberry.",92,55.0
3202,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Made from the native Sirica grape, this young red opens with wild berry and black pepper aromas. The smooth, vibrant palate offers a great combination of fruit and spice, doling out juicy Morello cherry, crushed raspberry and clove flavors, bolstered by polished tannins. Drink through 2020.",92,23.0
3203,Foxen,"This wine, from a prime block of a famous vineyard, shows nectarine flesh, lime and lemon peel, salted butter and green herbs on the nose. The palate is still wound a little tight, but reveals green pear, citrus pith, lime juice, cheese rind and a touch of sour grass. Hold until 2016.",91,32.0
3204,Montes,"Classic Carmenère aromas of spiced blackberry, olive, herbs and cola hint at green, but in the mouth this warm-vintage wine is ripe, lush and layered, with resiny oak. Flavors of cola, vanilla, blackberry and black cherry are nicely herbal, while a spicy finish brings char and coffee notes along with plush weight. Drink through 2018.",91,22.0
3205,Iron Horse,"From a vineyard block planted in 1990, this wine is distinguished by an earthy forest-floor characteristic, along with smoky oak and bacon, especially on the entry. Ripe dark cherry and spice entice on the finish, which is tingling in acidity and firm tannins.",90,85.0
3206,Wines & Winemakers,"A rare wine for Portugal, a 100% Merlot, this is dense, very rich and spicy. Plenty of juicy black fruits are still developing along with the concentrated tannins. It's a wine that is close to being too concentrated, saved by the fresher fruity end. Drink from 2018.",90,30.0
3207,Kendall-Jackson,"A soft, almost sweet version of a typically more crisp varietal, this is fruity, smooth in texture and uncomplicated. It has fresh citrus and apple flavors.",86,13.0
3208,Kendall-Jackson,"Tempting spicy aromas like cedar and clove lead to rich but bright fruit flavors shaded by smoke and black pepper. This wine has commendable complexity without going over the top, and a nice, firm texture of fine tannins and good acidity for balance.",89,17.0
3209,Testarossa,"This bottling comes from a vineyard belonging to winemaker Bill Brousseau's parents on the Salinas Valley's eastern slopes. The nose intrigues with iron-laced purple fruits and a touch of feral beef jerky. Blackberry and black pepper show on the palate, as does shaved nutmeg, dark chocolate shavings, bay leaf and a tart coffee element.",89,64.0
3210,Casa Santos Lima,"Produced from the Boavista vineyard at the base of Casa Santos Lima, this wine comes from old vines. It is a serious, complex and structured wine that will develop well over many years. Dark fruits, dense tannins and really fresh acidity are integrated into a fine wine. Drink this impressive wine from 2019.",89,
3211,Chanson Père et Fils,"This shows Savigny's softness and approachability, along with tannins and acids. It is firmly concentrated, creating a wine that feels complete, juicy and rich.",90,42.0
3212,Chanson Père et Fils,"This is a firm wine with great fruit density, with a round, generous and velvety texture. It has a touch of wood that needs to integrate with the flavor of red plum skin. The dark tannins create a wine that will age for several years.",90,52.0
3213,Robert Mondavi,"There's some sharpness on this Cabernet that kicks the palate, and also a raisin skin bitterness. On the plus side are lush, smooth tannins and quite a lot of sweet blackberry fruit. But the instabilities limit the wine's appeal, as well as its ageability, making it rustic. Drink now.",86,55.0
3214,Williams Selyem,"One of the producer's lighter-styled wines, delicately delicious, this shows forest floor, orange and lemon in a brightly crisp, high-toned package of polish and grace. A touch of rhubarb--strawberry compote lurks on the finish.",92,39.0
3215,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"This is an excellent Harvest Select bottling, with bright, sappy flavors that seem not all that sweet. The residual sugar, listed at 47 g/L, is an asset, but doesn't dominate. Flavors remain as crisp as a fresh Macintosh apple, juicy, forward and delicious.",90,10.0
3216,Testarossa,"A difficult Pinot Noir to evaluate. It's very dry, acidic and tannic, with sharp flavors of blackberries that sweeten into jam on the finish. The question is one of ageability. Try cellaring for five years and see what happens.",87,54.0
3217,Testarossa,"Palazzio is Testarossa's blend of various vineyards. It showcases a regional Central Coast personality, and a fine one at that. The '06 has elements of ripe cherries, raspberries and root beer, enriched with smoky oak, and appeals for its silky, crisp mouthfeel. Best now and for a year or two.",88,37.0
3218,DFJ Vinhos,"This is a rich blend of spicy, perfumed Shiraz and Touriga Nacional. Together they make a firm and dense wine. With rich black-plum fruit and a solidly structured character, it's ready to drink now.",90,15.0
3219,Testarossa,"Testarossa has an incredible track record with Bien Nacido Pinot Noir, and in 2007, they've produced as fine a wine as they've ever done. It's dry, crisp, silky and just wonderful in the mouth, with rewarding flavors of cherries, currants, cola, licorice, sautéed wild mushrooms, balsamic and pepper. Terrific and complex now, and should slowly age for at least sic years.",94,56.0
3220,Kendall-Jackson,"A gorgeous Cab that shows the density and concentration, but also the elegant structure, of a fine mountain vineyard. Dry and richly tannic, this 100% Cabernet has pinpoint flavors of currants, plums and cedar. Brilliant now, and should evolve through at least 2012.",94,70.0
3221,Testarossa,"Testarossa reserves their most expensive wines to a best-barrels blend that usually bears a statewide appellation, a practice that is rare if not unique among California wineries. The '07 Niclaire is vast in currants, rhubarbs, cola and cedar, with sizable but finely meshed tannins, and the tart acidity that marks all of the winery's 2007 Pinot Noirs. It's drinkable now, but just barely, so decant. But will benefit from up to six years in the cellar.",94,75.0
3222,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Coming largely from Canoe Ridge and Cold Creek vineyards, this wine leads with barrel aromas of toast and char out in front of peach. It's rich and full bodied, showing a sense of texture and gravitas. The oak is not shy the but the fruit stands up to it.",91,36.0
3223,Columbia Crest,"Aromas of vanilla, cocoa and dark berries lead to full-bodied and velvety coffee, cherry and dark fruit flavors. The oak plays prominently but this wine is still pretty hard to resist.",91,35.0
3224,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"Initially, the acidity shoots through this wine. Then it reveals equally intense honey and spice flavors. The wine is complex, with yellow fruits laced with nutmeg and finished with a tender, crisp aftertaste. It is never too sweet, a beautifully balanced wine in which all the elements play their part.",95,
3225,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"Hints of smokiness combine with a perfumed character in this wonderful wine. It has richness, with lychee and spice flavors, while adding the extra complexity of a touch of toast and green tea. Wonderful now, but will age for five years and more.",95,84.0
3226,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"This ultrarich, opulent wine has such purity of fruit. With its pepper and spice flavors layered over mango and ripe nectarine, it is a straight line of pure flavor, rich and complex.",95,74.0
3227,Kendall-Jackson,"This is an impressive undertaking, made from estate vineyards across the region, all certified sustainable. Medium in build and intensity, it allows acidity to balance out the strong, interwoven tannin and power to remain buoyant in high-toned cherry and currant. It finishes with a flourish of cinnamon spice.",91,26.0
3228,Kendall-Jackson,"Broad and warm notes of light butter, baked yellow apples, cracked apricot and sliced nectarine are lifted by lime-peel tension on the fresh nose of this bottling. Preserved lemon and toasted almond flavors show once sipped, framed by a creamy mouthfeel and tartness provided by orange bitters.",91,28.0
3229,Undurraga,"With a bouquet of dark plum and toasty oak, with an earthy barnyardy note, this wine from this older Bordeaux grape still cultivated in Chile has medium weight and some plum and caramel flavors. In the end, the wood is a bit much for the fruit, and it is not dissimilar to some Barberas from Italy's Piedmont that wear an overweight of oak.",84,12.0
3230,Undurraga,"Attractive and correct berry, plum and cocoa aromas open to a plummy palate, with a round mouthfeel. The cocoa and toast finish has easy tannins. Has all the right elements, but in a rather simple expression, wanting intensity.",83,7.0
3231,Santa Ema,A pleasant and cleanly made quaffing wine with plenty of berry and black-cherry fruit and a strong menthol streak running right through to the finish. A bit rough around the edges; might show better with a country-style dish of stewed chicken.,83,9.0
3232,Santa Ema,"Orangey aromas wrapped in not very subtle oak open this light-to-medium weight wine. Simple and a bit one-dimensional, it offers light pear flavors and a dry finish. Acceptable as an easy quaff, but not the stuff worthy of reserve designation.",83,14.0
3233,Concha y Toro,"Offers varietally correct flavors of black currants and hints of tobacco, but where's the structure and depth? A simple, fruity red for early drinking that would make a decent picnic wine or bar pour.",83,8.0
3234,Undurraga,"With a vegetal note, some cocoa and berry on the nose and its simple, rather flat flavor profile, this Cabernet suffers from both vintage deficiencies and over-oaking. Dry and woody on the back end.",82,12.0
3235,Undurraga,"A light and tart wine, with a bouquet of berry, tea and a touch of barnyard. On the palate, there's more cherry, tea and oak. The fundamental Pinot characteristics are here, but it turns drying and a bit sour on the finish.",82,7.0
3236,Undurraga,"Wearing a heavy mantle of rather green, not-too-subtle oak, the fruit in this wine struggles to be noticed. Faintly apple, with earthy notes, it is fairly buried, and the wine lacks the life and dimension on the palate one seeks in a wine with reserve status.",82,12.0
3237,Santa Ema,"Fresh asparagus, green bean, lime and mineral make for a textbook coastal Chilean SB nose. The palate is fresh, crisp, clear and lean, with zesty lemon-lime, lettuce, asparagus and tangerine flavors. Long and lasting on the finish, with a spot of sweetness at the end.",87,18.0
3238,Santa Ema,"Woody aromas of oak grain blend with scented candle wax and briny stone-fruit notes. This feels chunky yet high in malic acid. Salty flavors of popcorn and apple cider carry a strong barrel influence, while this finishes with resiny oak and briny white-fruit flavors.",87,18.0
3239,Gary Farrell,"Despite some big, fuzzy tannins, this Syrah is for drinking now. It just doesn't have the density for aging. But it does offer pleasant black currant, pepper, plum, tobacco and crispy bacon flavors. Give it some time in a decanter before serving.",88,40.0
3240,Columbia Crest,"The red wine companion to the excellent Two Vines Vineyard 10 White has got some stuffing, tannins and chewy, herbal flavors, but the fruit holds its own with flavors of wild plum and rhubarb.",85,8.0
3241,V. Sattui,"This is easy to like for its clean, brisk mouthfeel, creaminess and slightly sweet flavors of lime and strawberry. Made from Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, it shows real finesse.",90,29.0
3242,Siduri,"Crisp and vibrant, this is also rich and flashy. It has the essence of ripe, wild raspberries that are spiced and smoked up in oak, leaving you dazzled by its allure.",90,48.0
3243,Chanson Père et Fils,"Big and showy, with an ripe, opulent feel, this is all about dark fruits and firm tannins. Flavors of black cherries and plums are balanced by the acidity, all rolled together into a structure that's powerful and seriously age-worthy.",94,248.0
3244,Chanson Père et Fils,"This is a ripe Pinot Noir, with a firm and solid structure and a very dense character. It has concentration and a great depth of flavor; the blacks fruits and tannins cut into the heart of the wine. Age for at least seven years.",94,187.0
3245,Chanson Père et Fils,"Big, rich and powerful, this uses grapes sourced from a small section of the Corton hill that's close to Charlemagne. It has the ripe pineapple and apricot flavors to go with the acidity. With its enormous concentration, this is ready to age over at least 10 years.",94,175.0
3246,Foxen,"Few winemakers in Santa Barbara County understand better than Bill Wathan how to let the terroir of individual vineyards shine, while still providing consumers with a delicious drinking experience. This bottling shows the juicy, ripe flavors one expects from Dijon clones, with flashy notes of raspberries, cherries and currants. It's balanced in crisp acidity, and there's a tangy, dry minerality. Drink now–2016.",94,60.0
3247,Louis Latour,"Richly structured, this wine is all texture at this stage—although the rich fruit lingers underneath. Apple, pear and citrus fruits give this opulent, powerful wine its freshness. This has a great future ahead.",94,130.0
3248,Louis Latour,"Using grapes sourced from the greatest white-wine vineyard in Burgundy, this is huge, dense, very rich and complex. The balance already shows in the wine's acidity, ripe yellow fruit and round texture. Wood aging brings notes of spice and toast. This will age for many years.",94,430.0
3249,Kendall-Jackson,"True to its legacy, K-J's V.R. Chard is almost off-dry and soft in style, with pleasant mango, peach, orange and vanilla flavors. It's an easy-drinking wine to enjoy with everyday picnic or beach fare.",85,17.0
3250,Wines & Winemakers,"On the nose, this is rough and rustic. If the palate is less obviously barnyard, it still carries something of that character, with blackberry and wood flavors along with spicy accents. The wine is still young, so the rough edges could smooth out. Drink from 2015.",85,18.0
3251,Wines & Winemakers,"This is an intensely fruity wine that is lemon scented, crisp and very fresh. It has a strong citrus flavor, with touches of orange zest and red apples. Not for aging, this light, bright wine is ready to drink now.",85,12.0
3252,Wines & Winemakers,"This is a light, fresh and crisply fruity wine. It is dominated by lime and ripe lemon flavors that come from the bright blend of Fernão Pires and Arinto. Not a wine for aging, so drink now.",85,13.0
3253,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Production has zoomed to almost 11,000 cases, but the quality remains. Deep, delicious flavors of melon, grapefruit and kiwi anchor the wine. The sensation of wet rocks and bracing minerality runs alongside the lip-smacking fruit. Perfectly ripe, dense and wonderfully sappy, this is a real gem.",92,18.0
3254,Georges Duboeuf,"From one of the many cru estates that are run by Beaujolais merchant Georges Duboeuf, this wine is smooth, generous and juicy. It has red-cherry fruit that is surrounded by some firm tannins as well as juicy acidity. Drink from late 2017.",88,20.0
3255,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"This has a lightly funky nose that leads into a rather flat midpalate, with barrel toast and simple red fruit. It all resolves quickly into a one-dimensional finish.",85,16.0
3256,Fess Parker,"This bottling from neutral barrels is reserved on the nose, showing dust, light red fruit and earth aromas. The flavors are equally light, evoking red mulberry fruit and turned earth. Clean and quaffable, but not very exciting.",87,55.0
3257,Wines & Winemakers,"This is heavily wood dominated. Toast and juice come from wood as much as fruit at this stage. Behind this, generous yellow fruits and a ripe, full-bodied character will lead to a ripe and complex wine. It needs aging, so don't drink before 2016.",90,
3258,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"Crisp acidity and citrus fruitiness combine with a riper, textured character. The wine shows the strong minerality inherent in whites from Pernand-Vergelesses, as well as a richer streak. Because of its structure, it should age. Drink from 2016.",91,73.0
3259,Kendall-Jackson,"Lemon butter, apple pie crust and hazelnut are first to the aroma party on this carefully crafted Jackson family offering from a vineyard about 400 feet up in limestone-dotted soils. On the palate, strong but integrated acidity carries the myriad citrus, apple and spice flavors to completion.",91,30.0
3260,Louis Latour,"Fruity and ripe, it also presents a fresh feel that cuts through the jammy red fruits and gives an edge to the weight and velvet texture. It's almost ready to drink but will be better from 2015.",91,75.0
3261,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Here's a poised and structured wine that offers fragrances of jasmine, acacia, Spanish broom and flint. Creamy peach, citrus and honeydew carry the palate, along with energizing mineral notes. It's fresh and well-balanced, with crisp acidity.",91,31.0
3262,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"The aromas bring notes of milk chocolate, spice and red fruit, along with high-toned vanilla accents. The fruit and barrel flavors are plush and full, while still showing a lovely sense of balance.",90,18.0
3263,Casa Santos Lima,"This is Sauvignon Blanc with a cool, herbal twist to it. It is crisp, full of green stone fruits, along with a lively lemon juicy acidity. Perfumed and packed with fruitiness, it is ready to drink.",87,15.0
3264,Columbia Crest,"Single-vineyard Rieslings are rare in the state, especially dry ones. This one offers aromas of green apple and lime zest that lead to dry citrus filled flavors.",87,28.0
3265,Casa Santos Lima,"Aged for four months in wood, this is a spicy wine that has ripe red berry fruits and dark color from the Alicante Bouschet in the blend. Rich and full, it is a warm wine, ready for winter drinking.",87,15.0
3266,Maryhill,"Soft and lightly fruity, this has an underlying chalkiness. That chalky sensation runs across the palate and seems to mute the other flavors, such as herb, which are on the light side.",85,17.0
3267,Gary Farrell,"Black cherry, clove, allspice and fresh hibiscus make for an enticing nose on this wine by the longtime Russian River Valley producer. Rose petals, cranberry juice, dried oregano and more hibiscus together for a bountiful palate.",91,65.0
3268,Bründlmayer,"There is something eternally invigorating in this citrus-pure Riesling that smacks of grapefruit and lemon zest. There is a softer apple aspect too, uniting all in a fresh, pure fruitiness. There is something simply authentic at its very heart that keeps you sipping. And with such a light-bodied wine, you can (almost) do so with impunity.",93,35.0
3269,Kendall-Jackson,"This has polished blackberry and black currant flavors, touched with oak. It shows real elegance and class.",87,19.0
3270,Albert Bichot,"A solid, dense wine, its rich tannins dominating dark black fruits. The wine is ponderous, brooding, with shafts of acidity giving it a lift. But it does need a couple of years to soften that core of serious tannins.",89,
3271,Louis Latour,"With a touch of spice from the wood, this wine is full of yellow and apple fruits yet with a cool thread of acidity. It is a lively, bright wine, filled out with fruitiness. Drink from 2017.",91,50.0
3272,Wines & Winemakers,"With six months of oak aging, this wine has both richness and spicy concentration. It is densely structured and solid with tannins. The black fruits are spreading through the wine, giving another element of richness. Dark and dense, the wine needs to age further. Drink from 2018.",91,18.0
3273,Wines & Winemakers,"Aged for six months in wood, this juicy wine with its red-berry fruits is stylish and full bodied. It has tannins that act as a support to the bold fruits and firm structure. That suggests the wine, although ready to drink now, will also age. Drink now or keep until 2018.",88,14.0
3274,Wines & Winemakers,"The wine has blackberry fruits that give attractive acidity and add to the light structure. It is fruity, juicy and ready to drink.",88,10.0
3275,DFJ Vinhos,"Light and fruity, the wine has a smooth edge that is cut with acidity. It is an immediately accessible wine with a lzesty lemon finish.",85,9.0
3276,Georges Duboeuf,"Produced from vines around the grand chateau, this is a crisp wine that has banana flavors and tight red-currant acidity that is crisp and lightly perfumed. It will probably be softer from early 2017.",85,17.0
3277,Casa Santos Lima,"This wine is ripe, full of black fruits and with hints of licorice and dark chocolate. The spice from the wood aging still shows strongly although that will integrate over the next few months. Drink this ripe wine from 2017.",85,10.0
3278,Gary Farrell,"An intensity of petrol-like oakiness on the nose of this wine suggests a youthful coiling that's yet to unravel. Still, plenty of promise is revealed, from robust yet floral elements of golden apple and honey to the effusive back notes of peach. Medium bodied, it finishes crisp and creamy, an expert combination of strength and elegance. Drink now through 2020.",95,55.0
3279,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Yellow stone fruit, citrus and Mediterranean brush aromas float out of the glass. On the bright, tangy palate, mature apricot and nectarine flavors mingle with savory mineral notes and hints of chopped herb.",89,20.0
3280,Trapiche,"Deep, dense, compact aromas of black fruits, marzipan and sandalwood are exotic and inviting. This blend of Malbec and Cabernet Franc feels flush and layered, while integrated flavors of chocolate, blackberry, spice and oak finish long and woody, but not overly oaky. Drink through 2017.",91,75.0
3281,Georges Duboeuf,"Big and solid, this is very firm in character. It has weight, density and dry tannins. At the same more juicy black fruits and acidity emerge from this mineral textured wine. Powered by its structure, it could well age for 3–5 years.",91,
3282,Concha y Toro,"Intense and black up front, with coconut, tobacco and blackberry aromas. Feels round and plump, with dark, toasty flavors of mildly herbal berry and cassis. Finishes warm, spicy, a little heavy and with tannic grip. A fun wine that's big boned and concentrated.",88,22.0
3283,DFJ Vinhos,"Rarely used on its own, Alicante Bouschet from the cooler Lisboa region can obviously produce an impressively structured wine. Naturally juicy, the wine also has firmer tannins, damson fruit flavors and balancing acidity. Drink now, or keep until 2015.",91,13.0
3284,Kunde,"Zinfandel combines the variety's classic flavors of spices, briary wild summer blackberries and raspberries, cola and licorice with Merlot-like silky balance and elegance. While there's a wonderful sweetness, the finish is dry. An absolute steal, and relatively easy to find, with 5,000 cases produced.",91,22.0
3285,Chehalem,"Chehalem makes four different Rieslings, and this is often the best of them. Rich and complex, it's dense with grapefruit, lemon, lime, apple and flavors of wet stone. Lovely in the mouth, it lingers gracefully through the finish.",91,29.0
3286,Testarossa,"Very inviting and familiar aromas of sea salt, squeezed citrus, baked lemons Gravenstein apple and a touch of slate show on this crowd-pleaser from Bill Brousseau and Rob Jensen in Los Gatos. The palate is framed by slightly sour kumquat, tart apple and lime-powered acidity, with a cementy grip that makes the sip as much about texture as flavor.",91,48.0
3287,Kunde,"Tasty and easy to drink, this has blackberry, black currant and cola flavors that finish seemingly sweet and oaky. It's an intense wine that doesn't seem likely to make gains with age, so drink up after an hour or two in the decanter.",87,45.0
3288,Foxen,"Delicious aromas of ripe cherry pie and black cardamom are quite sexy. The palate is far more complicated and layered, with the tartness of plum skins, richness of strawberry, balsamic reduction and spiciness of black sage.",94,35.0
3289,Williams Selyem,"Continuing to preserve this historic vineyard, a rare planting of the variety within the appellation, this is an elegant yet explosive bottling. Blackberry and stone fruit tones are framed by soft, gentle tannins, sprinkled liberally with cardamom. A floral aroma permeates gently refreshing acidity and a finish of dark chocolate.",94,55.0
3290,Lynmar,"Made from both grapes directly pressed into wine as well as bled off, this crisply complex offering is springtime in a glass, a soft and supple evoking of fresh-cut pineapple that remains dry and delicious without ever overreaching. Medium in body, with a hint of dried herb on the back palate, it offers structure and just the right amount of weight.",93,20.0
3291,Wines & Winemakers,"The wine is still young. Made from old vines and produced in a traditional way with indigenous yeasts, it is a wine that needs to age. It has a rich, concentrated fruitiness along with intense acidity and lemon flavor. The wine is ripe and full. Drink from 2017.",89,23.0
3292,Louis Latour,"This perfumed wine features ripe tannins and strawberry flavors. It is structured, with good concentration and acidity. The wine is developing well with the richness as well as line of fresher acidity. Drink from 2019.",89,80.0
3293,Gary Farrell,A scent of French butter offers an immediate invitation to this excellent wine. Austerity on the palate gives way to a juicy core of invigorating tangerine and white peach flavors. The gravelly minerality on the midpalate finishes softly and with ease.,95,35.0
3294,Iron Horse,"Combining 76% Pinot Noir and 24% Chardonnay, this wine has a depth of richness and focused, supportive acidity that work well to complement each other. Stone fruit, vanilla biscuit, cherry kirsch and green apple are all within the spectrum of flavors here, finishing with grace and a hint of spice.",95,44.0
3295,Chanson Père et Fils,"An intensely perfumed wine that smells of a candy shop. It has tight acidity, but that is lost in the welter of white fruit flavors, allied with sweet wood. It seems at first too sweet, but then toast and acidity come in to give the wine an edgy finale.",87,60.0
3296,Columbia Crest,"The H3 Cab comes across as a more tightly defined, sharp-edged version of the Merlot. Same berry flavors, a bit more acid, and a sense that the wine goes deeper into the palate, though with less breadth. It feels taut in the middle, as if needing more bottle age and/or breathing time to flesh out, but the structure is sound and the flavors clean and varietal.",87,15.0
3297,Testarossa,"Released at less than one year of age, this wine is immature, almost a barrel sample. It's vibrant in cherries, milk chocolate and new oak, but disjointed. Needs time. Give it until late 2009 to come together.",87,59.0
3298,Bründlmayer,"Ripe citrus notes appear immediately, recalling Amalfi lemon with rounder notions of tangerine and mandarine. The palate slims down to a light-footed, slender core of juicy, friendly and invigorating freshness. Streamlined and lemony, it evokes a citrusy brightness that seems almost cleansing.",91,26.0
3299,Columbia Crest,"Somewhat aromatically restrained with notes of kiwi, pineapple and citrus. It's somewhat sleek in style but has with a lightly creamy feel. The wine is enjoyable but the acidity doesn't quite seem to be there to pull it all together.",86,15.0
3300,Concha y Toro,"Wild berry aromas come with a cool hint of herbal mint. This is full, grabby and solid in the mouth. Flavors of dark fruits come across lightly stewed and pruny, while the finish dishes up a final taste of prune and foresty notes.",86,11.0
3301,Concha y Toro,"There's no shortage of black-fruit aromas on the nose. However, the palate is bumpy and jagged in feel, with hard-driving black currant, wild blackberry and licorice flavors. A shearing finish with punchy acidity is not congruent with the rest of the wine.",86,17.0
3302,Maryhill,"While the brooding notes of dark cherries, herbs and barrel spices bring some interest, the palate comes off as quite astringent and distracts.",86,40.0
3303,Maryhill,"A blend of Syrah (52%), Grenache (35%) and Mourvèdre, this brings notes of vanilla, white pepper and cherry. It's tart and medium bodied with chocolaty flavors, but the concentration doesn't seem entirely there.",86,32.0
3304,Maryhill,"A blend of fruit from Gunkel and Elephant Mountain vineyards, this wine offers light aromas of cherry and toasty barrel spice. The flavors are elegant, tart and juicy, with cocoa flavors lingering on the finish.",87,36.0
3305,Maryhill,"The oak (50% new French wood) seems a bit heavy handed, interjecting scents of wood, coffee and vanilla on the aromas and flavors. It's a shame as the cranberry flavors otherwise provide interest.",87,40.0
3306,Maryhill,"The aromas offer notes of cherry, baking and barrel spices and are topped off with partially amped-up volatiles. The flavors are lush and full bodied, lingering on the finish.",87,40.0
3307,Kendall-Jackson,"Tasted just after bottling, the wine was a little bottle-shocked, but should be fine by Summer 2010. Rich and creamy, with complex tropical fruit, buttered toast, lemondrop candy and honeysuckle flavors. An amazing 111,000 cases were produced.",90,21.0
3308,Columbia Crest,"Though it lacks the broad, sweet fruit of the 2005 reserve, this is a fine reflection of the vintage. It's compact, tannic, and a bit unyielding, but structured with enough density to age for a few years. Light red fruits are somewhat overwhelmed by grainy, toasty tannins; that should balance out with a little more bottle age.",89,27.0
3309,V. Sattui,"This is easy to like for its clean, brisk mouthfeel, creaminess and slightly sweet flavors of lime and strawberry. Made from Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, it shows real finesse.",90,29.0
3310,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"This bears apple and pear flavors that are set amidst buttery, toasty accents. It's smooth and easy to drink, and the mouthfeel has a certain oiliness.",87,13.0
3311,Maryhill,"This herbal, tannic Syrah is a serviceable bottle that would be especially good with a simple flank steak. Scents are a mix of grape blossom, cherry and coffee. The wine is solid and one dimensional and finishes with a strong herbal streak.",84,20.0
3312,Casa Santos Lima,"With Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend, this is a strongly structured wine. It is dark and tannic, acidity laced with dark plum flavors. This firm wine is still young and should be aged for at least a year, so drink from 2017.",87,10.0
3313,V. Sattui,"An amazing wine, so rich and unctuous it's like a late harvest dessert wine. May even have a little botrytis in the intense pear, banana and tropical fruit flavors, but it's really very dry. A whole lot of sweet oak pushes the volume even higher.",89,25.0
3314,Kunde,"Shows the classic Kunde signature of pure, intense Merlot, at a good price. Soft and ripe with cherries, licorice and mocha, it's a gentle, easy wine to drink now.",87,18.0
3315,Kunde,"Oak dominates this wine, with buttered toast and caramel flavors riding high over orange, green apple and mango notes. The acidity is mouthwatering, adding vibrance to sheer California power.",87,35.0
3316,Testarossa,"Dense in its core with aromas of black fruit, rose buds, chipped slate and a touch of anise, this also has a cran-raspberry freshness that emerges on the nose with time. The palate is redolent with dried thyme, oregano, marjoram and fennel that meet with cooked cranberry fruit and turned-earth flavors.",92,64.0
3317,Louis Latour,The wine has density and a good structure. It also has the acidity that marks the vintage. Red-cherry fruits and a crisp texture are balanced by the firmer tannins and solid character at the end. Drink from 2020.,92,79.0
3318,Foxen,"Light and fresh aromas of red cherry, dark strawberry and sagebrush make for a fairly easy but rather deep nose on this single-vineyard bottling. Rich cranberry and pomegranate flavors coat the palate, with compelling edges of fennel, root beer and light clove.",92,68.0
3319,Columbia Crest,"Numerous sites in the Horse Heaven Hills didn't produce fruit in 2011 due a late 2010 freeze. This wine bears witness to the glory of the vines that survived unscathed with its notes of huckleberry, dark coffee and smoked meat. The flavors are silky soft and glide along to a lingering, chocolate-filled finish.",92,30.0
3320,Undurraga,"On first take, this small-batch blend of País and Cinsault is overtly oaky, with earthy berry and plum notes lurking in the background. A drawing tannic palate lets you know that País is in the house, while this tastes of oaky berry and plum. On the finish, this is more resiny and woody than toasty. Only 235 cases made. Drink through 2021.",90,30.0
3321,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Barrel aromas of vanilla, coconut and toast are at the fore followed by luxurious coffee and plum flavors that linger. Grainy tannins back it all up.",88,18.0
3322,V. Sattui,"A full-bodied wine bursting in chocolate and leather, this also displays plenty of cooler vintage and cooler stylistic sensibilities, from jolts of black currant and cedar to a sanguine taste of game in the background. The finish is all about tannic power.",88,90.0
3323,V. Sattui,"The color of this wine with 11.6% residual sugar is dark gold and the aromas all raisin and dried apricot. Thick and rich, it has a wealth of vanilla and caramel toffee to offer, with a need for cheese.",88,42.0
3324,Concha y Toro,"This is one heavily oaked wine: It smells like smoke, tar and baked berry. The palate is short on substance and high on acid, so the flavors are racy and angular, and with all the oak influence this wine smells and tastes charred, toasted and blackened.",84,22.0
3325,Robert Mondavi,"This shows brisk, mouthwatering Central Coast acidity, which brightens the slightly sweet lemon and lime flavors.",84,11.0
3326,Robert Mondavi,"Simple, crisp and clean, this tastes like grapefruit juice, and a squeeze of lime, plus hints of honey and vanilla.",84,11.0
3327,DFJ Vinhos,"Spicy wine from the wood and from the ripe berry fruits. The acidity is light, a sideshow to the juicy fruit, flavors of nutmeg and red cherries and a fine kick of dry tannin.",86,8.0
3328,Montes,"There's no denying this wine's green character, which blends with aromas of hay, red berry and scratchiness. On the palate, it feels a bit syrupy, countered by acidity. It tastes savory, with sweet, chocolaty and barbecued flavors. It turns oakier on the finish.",86,15.0
3329,Santa Ema,"While this Cabernet Sauvignon-driven blend opens with fiery, herbal aromas of plum and cherry, time helps it along. A fairly raw and juicy palate is far from cushioned, while herbal, roasted flavors of plum and currant are spicy and fold in patented Chilean flavors of olive and herbs. Drink through 2020.",90,85.0
3330,Siduri,"One of Adam Lee's more affordable appellation blends, this delivers a lot of bang for the buck, with aromas of extracted strawberry, rich plum, sandalwood and a slate backbone. Soft red fruit starts the palate, then sharpens into cranberry, with lots of herbal spice and acidic sizzle throughout.",90,34.0
3331,Wines & Winemakers,"This is a soft, ripe and fruity wine, full of red berry fruits, soft spiciness and attractive acidity. Big, rich and bold, it is a full-bodied and immediately attractive wine that will easily charge through spicy foods.",87,11.0
3332,Montes,"A little roasted and leafy smelling, which is typical for base-level Chilean Merlot. The palate is sweet almost to the brink of being candied, with plum and chocolate flavors running the show. Not much structure or tannic bite here, but as a whole it's tasty and gets better as it opens up.",85,12.0
3333,Bründlmayer,"Intense freshness and acidity follow the most delicious perfumes in this crisp wine. It shows considerable minerality, bursting with citric flavors and a mouthwatering aftertaste. Age for several years. Screwcap.",93,38.0
3334,Bründlmayer,"Edging towards minerality, this is a textured wine, its acidity penetrating right through. This intense, crisp character is complimented by the balanced fruit with its ripe apricot and kiwi flavors. Age for 2–3 years. Screwcap.",92,32.0
3335,Kendall-Jackson,"This serious red blend puts together a texture firmed up with gripping tannins and acidity, flavors brimming with blackberry and sweet spices and a lingering finish. Too structured to appreciate alone, it will need pairing with roast beef, lasagna, ribs or the like.",88,17.0
3336,Concha y Toro,"Warm, earthy, dusty aromas of red plum and smoky oak turn toastier the longer this sits. A fresh but balanced palate offers equal amounts of snappy acidity and creamy weight, while tart plum and spice flavors finish toasty and charred, with crisp acidity generating length.",88,26.0
3337,Casa Santos Lima,"This is a pale colored, attractively perfumed wine. With red berry fruit flavors, bright acidity and a lively orange zest texture, it is fruity and ready to drink.",86,9.0
3338,Foxen,"This appellation blend is nowhere near as amazing as the winery's single-vineyard expressions from this vintage, but it'll work for an everyday sipper. Light red cherry meets with damp herbs, wet hay and forest floor on the nose, while the simple palate combines red fruit with more herbs and orange peels.",87,35.0
3339,Maryhill,"This wine's bright raspberry jam, pencil lead and barrel spice aromas lead to quite ripe, dried out fruit and barrel flavors. The tannins are a bit drying.",87,45.0
3340,Testarossa,"A bit on the soft, easy side, with sweet, pie-filling flavors of cherries, red currants, licorice, vanilla and cinnamon spice. Ready now, with baked ham or fruit-glazed grilled pork or veal.",87,34.0
3341,Kendall-Jackson,"This medium-bodied wine has an abundance of spices in its aromas and flavors, along with a smooth texture and good balance between acidity and ripeness. The fruit flavors are plummy and straightforward and the easy drinkability is undeniable.",88,20.0
3342,Albert Bichot,"This wine shows the structured side of Gevrey-Chambertin. The vineyard is situated at the opening of a small side valley, a location that allows the grapes to ripen slowly. This is elegant and structured, and it's full of solid tannins as well as cherry and red berry flavors. Age this for 7–8 years.",92,
3343,DFJ Vinhos,"Soft and on the fat side, this is an easy wine, with its pear and melon flavors, spiced up by some pepper and lime. An attractive, ripe mouthful.",84,10.0
3344,DFJ Vinhos,"A wine that is all about crispness, with its green apple slices, pink grapefruit and lime flavors. The sweet acidity gives it shape.",84,9.0
3345,Louis Latour,"This wine has both structure and ripe red-plum fruits. It is dark and dense, solid and with good acidity. A clear line of freshness promises a good future. This needs time, so don't drink before 2020.",91,120.0
3346,Kunde,"“Nu” seems to be Kunde's way of letting us know that this is an unoaked Chardonnay. It shows pure, untrammelled Chard flavors of green apples, peaches, pears, kiwis and limes. It's also a very crisp wine, as it did not undergo the malolactic fermentation.",88,18.0
3347,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Peach, cantaloupe, pear and a touch of citric zest characterize this expertly made white wine from southern Italy. Beyond the fruit aromas, you'll also pick up notes of white flower and mineral-flint that add dimension and complexity. Drink it well-chilled with seafood or white meat.",88,18.0
3348,Siduri,"The color is a bit murky, but the wine offers sound, solid varietal aromas and plenty of sweet fruit. It's definitely front-loaded, with sweet cherry/berry and a nicely managed finish with a lick of chocolate. It shows the California influence of the winemaker, who is based in Santa Rosa.",88,39.0
3349,Siduri,"Released in October, 2007, this would have benefited from additional time in the bottle, but there's no reason you can't cellar it. It's too young now, with a sharp, rude primary fruit character that's fresh and jammy in cherries, blackberries and cola. Hold until late in 2008 to let it meld together.",88,49.0
3350,Concha y Toro,"Smoky, toasty aromas rest on top of muscular plum and red berry scents. This is a fuller-bodied, chunky wine with good acidity and resiny, oak-based dryness to the palate. Berry and plum flavors are round and woody, while the finish is slightly tomatoey.",87,18.0
3351,DFJ Vinhos,"The Chardonnay and Alvarinho complement each other well, the one bringing a rounded texture, the other adding a fresh and mineral character. Together, they produce a refreshing, ripe wine that has attractive citrus and yellow fruits. Drink from 2015.",87,11.0
3352,Georges Duboeuf,"A big, bold and fruity wine that is full of ripe berry fruits, rich and generous. This is Beaujolais at its most exuberant, a celebration of delicious fruit. It could age, but is ready to drink.",91,
3353,DFJ Vinhos,"Here in the maritime climate north of Lisbon, Alfrocheiro works well to produce a rich, smooth and velvet textured wine, with a beautiful layer of acidity over the wood.",88,13.0
3354,DFJ Vinhos,"An attractive, fresh wine, the tannins and bright acidity giving a firm support to the lively berry fruits and dry tannin core. The aftertaste continues freshness.",88,13.0
3355,V. Sattui,"This lovely Sauvignon Blanc is a little sweet in honey. But the acidity is crisp, and there's a fine mineral undertow to the fresh peach, citrus and green apple flavors, so the finish feels dry and clean.",88,22.0
3356,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"The aromas of herb, kiwi and citrus are quite light. The tropical flavors are elegant and spritely, tingling the palate with a light effervescence.",86,10.0
3357,Gary Farrell,"From the rocky, volcanic soils of Durell, this white is exuberant in salty rock and sea spray, showing plenty of influence from the Pacific Ocean to its west. Sturdy in structure and length, the fruit is twisted in pink grapefruit and crisp apple, its underbelly a richer, warmer expression of toffee and caramel.",94,60.0
3358,Kendall-Jackson,"This Riesling is slightly sweet, but it's balanced by crisp acidity. The tangerine, green apple and peach flavors have a honeyed finish.",84,12.0
3359,Gary Farrell,"This wine offers lush aromas of orange blossom, rock, saline and pear, with a hint of richness that plays out like crème brûlée. Complex and layered, it remains light on its feet, with an undeniable streak of mineral and lime that lifts the finish.",91,50.0
3360,Kunde,"These old vines are famous for concentration, and this Zin surely is one of the most intense wines of the vintage. It's huge in wild berry, currant, licorice, dark chocolate, bacon and exotic spice flavors that go on and on. For all the richness, it's wonderfully balanced, with fine tannins and a crisp backbone of acidity. Drink now.",92,30.0
3361,DFJ Vinhos,"An impressive and elegant wine. It has a delicious line of juicy red and black berry fruits, powered with a fine balance of acidity and firm, chunky tannins. With good potential, give the wine 3–4 years.",92,15.0
3362,Santa Ema,"Give it air time and it'll give back floral raspberry and cherry aromas in front of a racy, forward-style palate that's got cherry and red plum flavors and integrated spice. Not overbearing; clean and dry on the finish. Atypical for a Carmenère-led prestige wine; it's more streamlined and red in character.",87,24.0
3363,Georges Duboeuf,"Well structured wine, the red cherry fruits laced with some banana hints. The wine is deliciously fruity, the tannin edge just a light coating.",84,12.0
3364,Albert Bichot,"Firmly touched by wood, this is a rich and also structured wine. It has spice as much as fruit at this stage, the juicy acidity lurking behind the toasty exterior. The wine should balance out but will need time. Drink from 2020.",91,75.0
3365,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Named after famed Horse Heaven Hills grower Mimi Nye, this wine brings aromas of toast, custard and pineapple. Fruit and barrel flavors weave together on the palate, carrying through the finish.",89,20.0
3366,Kunde,"This thick, grippy wine is enveloped in sweet, sticky tannin, with full-bodied elements of kirsch and vanilla. Combining 64% Cabernet Sauvignon with 24% Cabernet Franc and 12% Petit Verdot from an estate-farmed vineyard, it's intense.",90,100.0
3367,Chateau Ste. Michelle,Aromas of honeysuckle and ripe peach lead to lightly spritzy medium-sweet stone-fruit flavors. It provides easy-drinking appeal.,88,9.0
3368,DFJ Vinhos,"A firm, structured blend of 50-50 Pinot Noir and Touriga Nacional, this wine is rich and made to age. A dense texture underlies the ripe blackberry fruits and firm tannins. Aged for 18 months in wood, the wine needs time to mature further. Drink from 2018.",91,19.0
3369,Louis Jadot,"Red-berry fruits and a full-bodied texture form the hallmark of this ripe wine. It has spice, a rich character that is generous and fruity. The wine is ready to drink.",88,14.0
3370,Montes,"This starts out with murky, leathery aromas that veer toward latex and rubber. It has tannic grip and decent structure. The wine tastes of roasted berry fruit and saucy plum, followed by a baked-tasting finish.",85,12.0
3371,Williams Selyem,"Since this is the winery's largest production Pinot, but still under 1,000 cases, buyers actually have a chance of finding this full-bodied beauty. Sly on the nose, it is tense in toasty oak and chewy cherry, venturing into black cherry, blackberry and root beer. It's amply structured and robust, yet with silky tannins. Enjoy through 2022.",95,52.0
3372,Bründlmayer,"Streamlined, citric freshness dominates every delicious aspect of this wine: the fresh, zingy nose, the ripe and supremely juicy palate with its swirls of both ripe and tart apples, and the extended finish. This is mouth-watering stuff. It's cushioned but extremely sleek, apple-fruity, very moreish and so very pure.",95,41.0
3373,Williams Selyem,"The winery's second vintage from this site, Calegari is medium-weight, with structured oak and a silky palate. It's a ripe expression of anise and red cherry that's juicy, spicy and complex, with pretty violet aromas.",95,55.0
3374,Williams Selyem,"Initially, this wine is all about strawberry tart, with layers of cardamom and white pepper as well as hints of blueberry and blackberry on the back palate. Offering high-toned fruit and acidity, it settles on the finish, becoming rich and full bodied in style, with final notes of nutmeg, vanilla and chocolate.",94,55.0
3375,Bründlmayer,"A creamy nose shows spikes of green freshness, reminiscent of fern or ivy. The palate holds peppery, citrusy spray with creamy generosity while white pepper and ripe pear appear at the seams. The long finish is whistle-clean. This will blossom into further aromatic intensity with a little age. Drink as of 2016.",94,36.0
3376,Testarossa,"Made from selected lots of Testarossa's various vineyards up and down the state, hence the California appellation, this is also the winery's most expensive Pinot Noir. Right now, it's not showing terribly well. There's something closed and stubborn about it. Partly that's the tannins and acidity, but mostly it may be because these scattered lots simply haven't come together yet to make nice. Give it 3–4 years.",92,79.0
3377,Iron Horse,"This vintage was a good one for Iron Horse, resulting in this wine of finesse and clarity. It's fruit-forward, with excellent acidity and a sour, yeasty bite help to balance its rich quality. The mousse is exceptionally refined. This has the potential to age quite well over the next decade.",92,98.0
3378,Iron Horse,"This blend is a classic brut, of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. Each variety plays its best hand, with Pinot Noir bringing rich, ripe raspberries, strawberries and tannins. The Chardonnay brings acidity and tantalizing notes of limes. With a silky, refined mousse, this bubbly is extremely attractive.",92,40.0
3379,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"Still firm, this wine is dominated by tannin and dark fruit, with a dry core typical of this Pommard vineyard. The red and dark plum-fruit flavors are developing slowly and the wine needs time to balance. Drink from 2019.",91,109.0
3380,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"The 20th anniversary of this bottling, this wine is principally Cabernet Sauvignon (70%) and Merlot (26%) with the fruit coming largely from Canoe Ridge and Cold Creek vineyards. Alluring café au lait, toast, dark chocolate and cherry aromas are followed by black and blue fruit flavors that linger on the finish.",91,65.0
3381,Columbia Crest,"This wide-open, flavorful wine is lifted by accents of tobacco and cocoa that sit above the light and pretty cherry flavor. The finish is laden with a mocha note, which provides a pleasing conclusion.",88,15.0
3382,Trapiche,"This is another excellent Malbec in Trapiche's single-vineyard series. Aromas of anise and licorice are exotic and a bit unusual, while blueberry, blackberry and herbal hints fill out the bouquet. The palate is full and jammy, maybe a touch soft, with layered flavors of black fruits, pepper and toast. A stocky finish with a licorice reprise shows a spot of heat. Drink through 2017.",92,50.0
3383,Georges Duboeuf,"Powerful tannins dominate this serious wine. It has a complex, dense structure, full of wood and fruit tannins, along with blackberry fruits and a touch of spiced bitter cherry. This is Beaujolais for aging. Give it at least 3–5 years.",92,
3384,Casa Santos Lima,"This wine is all fruit, ripe and full in the mouth. Touches of wood aging have given an extra dimension to the berry fruits and bright acidity. It's ready to drink.",85,

3386,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"The aromas of lychee and rose water pop. The palate brings a slight spritz, with lighter-bodied flavors that linger on the finish. The style is reserved but it shows a good sense of balance.",87,10.0
3387,Columbia Crest,"Brooding, very varietal aromas of grass, herbs and citrus lead to broad fruit flavors that dip in the middle, with some reduction providing a bit of distraction. It doesn't quite stand up on its own but should perk up at the dinner table.",87,24.0
3388,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Vanilla, baking spice, huckleberry, herb and blackberry aromas are at the fore. The black and blue-fruit flavors are soft and supple, bringing light savory notes that provide appeal.",87,15.0
3389,Williams Selyem,"This is an exceptional Zinfandel from a renowned site, as famous for Pinot Noir and Chardonnay as it has now become for Zin. Heady aromas of raspberry, blackberry and boysenberry tease before coming to life on the palate, accented by a delightful complement of allspice and juicy acidity. Medium bodied, it's incredibly easy to enjoy and rich in all the right ways.",94,55.0
3390,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"Zind-Humbrecht owns some great Grand Cru vineyards, perhaps none more so than the Clos Saint Urbain. This luscious, rich, sweet wine shows both power and intensity without losing any sense of structure. It's young, needing many years to show off its full potential. Drink from 2018.",94,105.0
3391,DFJ Vinhos,"Full honey- and melon-flavored wine, with a soft-textured character. It is full of ripe red apples, well made, if internationally anonymous.",85,9.0
3392,Undurraga,"Smoky and crusty on the nose, but not that deep or dark in the mouth. The emphasis is on red fruits, freshness and pop, while the flavors are zesty and lean toward red cherry and red plum, with a spicy accent. Pepper and more spice work the finish.",88,15.0
3393,Louis Latour,"This fruity, very fresh wine has attractive acidity under its crisp apple and citrus flavors. It is light in texture, just tangy from lemon zest and with a bright, refreshing aftertaste.",86,
3394,Iron Horse,"With plenty of estate-farmed vineyards, this producer is diving deeper into single blocks and clones with its 2012 releases, providing the opportunity to hone in on an array of tastes. Deer Gate is relatively warm, and the resulting fruit is quite ripe, yielding bold red and black cherry notes around savory dried herb and oak accents.",92,85.0
3395,Kunde,"The winery claims the vines date back to 1882; the wine is a stunner, with rich, old vine complexity mixing cherries, leafy old-vine flavors, smooth chocolaty oak. Smooth, seductive, delicious.",90,24.0
3396,Kunde,"Herbs and spices dominate the nose, and the wine has an intriguing blend of 9% Petite Sirah, 2% Grenache and 2% Mourvèdre in it. Interesting and flavorful, though not entirely varietal in character. The mix of spices tastes a bit like a Provençal wine, and it's delicious for the price.",89,15.0
3397,Fess Parker,"Cooked black cherry, black soil and a pinch of pine sap combine for an intriguing nose on this clonal study. The flavors are clove-driven around a pomegranate-cherry backdrop, with a touch of cola and expertly balanced tannins and acidity.",92,55.0
3398,Foxen,"One of Foxen's block designates from the historic property, this offers scents of purple flowers, black soil and sharp dill. It's quite smooth once sipped and not very complicated, but with fresh raspberry and brown spice.",92,62.0
3399,Kendall-Jackson,"With a deep golden color, this late-harvest Riesling has rich flavors of apricots and pears. It's a little on the soft side, lacking the crispness to give balance to the sweetness. Drink now.",86,25.0
3400,Siduri,"Nutmeg, allspice and chestnuts provide a warmth and sense of hearth to this robust, full-bodied wine, from a special site in the heart of Santa Rosa. Candied cherry dominates on the palate, the wine bright yet sultry, with a healthy, generous body and length.",90,50.0
3401,Gary Farrell,"From the historic family-owned vineyard down a ways on Westside Road, this Bacigalupi wine is richer and more layered than some of the producer's other vineyard-designates, providing a meatier, more tropical edge of fleshy butter and nuttiness. The aromatics balance things out, sharing whispers of orange blossom and caramel.",90,50.0
3402,Georges Duboeuf,"From one of the properties where Duboeuf does vinification and bottling at the estate, this is a dense and structured wine. While it does have intense, young acidity, it also offers ripe berry fruits that are bold and rich. Drink from 2016.",90,20.0
3403,V. Sattui,"This proprietary blend brings together many of Napa Valley's old-vine grapes, from Zinfandel and Petite Sirah to Alicante Bouschet and Mourvèdre. Plum sauce, tobacco and leather are seasoned in black pepper and espresso within a full-bodied grippy package.",88,33.0
3404,Wines & Winemakers,"The Códega de Larinho grape produces a crisp style of wine that shows up well in the warm conditions of the region. With its delicious fresh character and blend of apple and grapefruit flavors, this light wine is ready to drink.",88,18.0
3405,Wines & Winemakers,"This is a field blend from old white vines. It has a tight, tangy texture to go with its rich fruits. The concentration and intense minerality are part and parcel of the old vines and the schist soil. It has a cool feeling, crisp and tight at the end. Drink from 2018.",88,14.0
3406,Robert Mondavi,"A big, dense, brooding wine, concentrated and powerful in blackberries, cherries and cassis. The tannins are sandpapery, giving the mouth a scoury feeling added to by the acids. An interesting, complex young wine that's well made and needs time to come around. Drink it over the next 6–8 years.",92,45.0
3407,Williams Selyem,"Another longtime standout for Williams Selyem, Allen Vineyard fruit imparts textural subtleties and a wealth of minerality and freshness. Citrus-driven in its cranberry and orange flavors, it shows depth and complexity, accented by lively thyme and clove notes.",95,82.0
3408,Williams Selyem,"From an organic, dry farmed vineyard, this wine is as feral as the forest—a study in wild boar, wildflowers and dried herbs. Bright acidity buoys that meaty quality in the form of tart rhubarb and strawberry tea flavors. Floral on the nose and palate, it's spicy too, with bold seasonings of clove and pepper.",95,95.0
3409,Williams Selyem,"Smoky clove and rose petal aromas underlie a delicately complex fruitiness in this wine, its cranberry and pomegranate flavors complemented by cardamon, dried herb and savory black tea. Light-bodied and fresh, it offers an indelible silkiness on the palate.",95,58.0
3410,Williams Selyem,"Full and plush on the palate, this wine shines in spicy red and black cherry, offering both a juicy core and sculpted texture. Finishing long, it retains a freshness of acidity, fine tannin and seamless oak. A dark, earthy expression of the grape with a twist of spice.",95,82.0
3411,Wines & Winemakers,"Rounded style of Vinho Verde with some weight to go with the extreme citrus and bright grapefruit flavors. It has a little softness round the edges, but the core is taut, mineral, tangy.",87,11.0
3412,Trapiche,"Baked apple, toast, spun sugar and fresh summer corn aromas are appealing and totally New World, while the palate is tropical in flavor and racy in feel. An example of acidity and ripe fruit working together to create a tasty but ripe-styled Chardonnay. Drink now.",88,17.0
3413,Fess Parker,"This is a dark and tarry wine, perhaps a tad early for release, showing condensed purple flowers, beef jerky, charcoal and plum peels on the nose. The palate is tart and chewy, with asphalt, sour black fruit and tobacco notes. Wait a year and this may sing much more strongly.",86,35.0
3414,Undurraga,"Undurraga's top Sauvignon hails from the premier terroir of Leyda. It smells clean and inviting, with an aromatic mix of talcum powder, lime, mango and scallion. The palate is very fresh and lively, with snappy citrus flavors that include grapefruit. Razor-clean on the finish.",89,22.0
3415,Foxen,"Foxen's UU Block from the famed Bien Nacido Vinbeard fights it out every year with the estate Tinaquaic Chardonnay for top honors. In this cool vintage, the former wins out by a hair. Dry, steely and crisp in acidity, it shows vast tropical fruit, orange, vanilla, honey and buttered toast flavors that are delicious and refined. The richness and elegance strongly suggest pairing it with lobster.",93,32.0
3416,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"A lovely, lush, complex and inviting nose brings rich cherry fruit, coffee grounds, smoke and toast right up front. The wine is ripe and fruity, but also shows tangy acidity, even hints of citrus and pineapple, and a lively mouthfeel that invites another sip. Still young and unevolved, it remains a bit disjointed, but with many interesting components.",91,38.0
3417,Montes,"Like the name suggests, this Carmenère is opaque purple in color, with earthy, complex aromas of graphite, char and herbal black currant. The palate is, not surprisingly, saturated and dense. Flavors of toasty, minty black fruits are charred, while the finish tastes roasted, heavily oaked and blackened. Drink through 2021.",92,85.0
3418,Kendall-Jackson,"A little on the sweet, candied and soft side, with Lifesaver cherry and black raspberry flavors. But it's well balanced in acidity and is easy to drink.",86,17.0
3419,Trapiche,"Warm and honeyed Chardonnay with toast and melon aromas. The body is big but the acidity is staunch enough to keep things moving. Flavors of toast and coconut sweeten up apple and melon fruit, and the finish is lasting.",86,12.0
3420,Williams Selyem,"This is a blend of some of the winery's best vineyards. The '06 is quite a good wine, but showcases some of the limitations of the vintage. Structurally, it's fine, with a good acid-tannin balance, but it could be more concentrated. The cherry and currant flavors are a little unfocused.",89,65.0
3421,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Forward and spicy, this puts some muscle into the Merlot with earthy, tongue-gripping tannins. The fruit has a sweet tomato flavor, with a streak of cherry candy. Though not entirely knit together, it's a pleasant drink best enjoyed young.",86,18.0
3422,Columbia Crest,"The blend has changed a bit with this latest Walter Clore Private Reserve, now 53% Merlot, 36% Cabernet Sauvignon and 11% Cabernet Franc—no Malbec. It seems a bit chewy and chalky. The fruit has a slightly candied aspect, with suggestions of fruitcake.",89,35.0
3423,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Though it's had some extra time in the bottle, the oaky edges of this wine still seem a little rough and tumble. Or maybe it's the banana cream pie flavors—appealing in their way, but opposite end of the spectrum from, say, the minerality of a Chablis. Front loaded, creamy and rich, this has generous amounts of the oak and toast that many consumers crave.",88,18.0
3424,Georges Duboeuf,"Full in the mouth, this is a rich and easy wine, packed with jammy fruit. It is soft, the plum flavors rounded and only light brushed by tannin and acidity.",88,
3425,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"This should prove to be quite popular, as it's loaded with blackberry and sweet black cherry fruit flavors. It carries the fruit with stiff but polished tannins, and brings in accents of licorice, coffee and dark chocolate. Nothing is overdone; the balance here is just right, and the addition of 16% Syrah brings with it a dash of pepper.",87,18.0
3426,Montes,"This SB has one of Chile's best track records for high quality. The nose and flavors both exceed norms, with the former showing bold citrus, lime and melon aromas and the latter revolving around grapefruit, lime and gooseberry. It's ripe, healthy, pithy, acid-driven and piercing. Summer sipping calls.",90,15.0
3427,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Pietracalda (which translates into “hot rock”) seems indeed to release aromas of sunbaked granite or river stone over lush background tones of peach, pear and yellow lemon zest. There's a drying, polished feel in the mouth with a touch of bitter almond on the close.",90,33.0
3428,Trapiche,"Bright and bold to the eye, this has generous, powerful berry aromas that come with a note of spice. It feels stacked and only slightly tangy, with black fruit and some of Syrah's more textbook flavors of leather and animal. It holds form on the finish.",87,10.0
3429,Georges Duboeuf,"This is fragrant and lighthearted, with citrusy acidity that laces through the easy, bright green-apple texture. It's crisp, with a floral finish.",85,18.0
3430,DFJ Vinhos,"Rich, spicy and deliciously fruity, it has tannins well cushioned by the ample blackberry flavors. Acidity preserves the wine's easy freshness, while it also has a dense texture. Drink now, but the wine will be richer in late 2014.",90,9.0
3431,V. Sattui,"A true GSM in its comingling of 67% Grenache with 24% Syrah and 9% Mourvèdre, this wine is burly in red and black cherry, while retaining a softness of texture and powerfully generous body weight. Cinnamon and earth round out the finish.",90,38.0
3432,Williams Selyem,"This white will appeal greatly to those who prefer stainless-steel treatment, with its tangle of sour apple, sharp acidity and full but not heavy texture. It gets better in the glass, softening that sharpness and tang, opening up to elements of melon and lime.",90,39.0
3433,Williams Selyem,"Concentrated jasmine aromas meet with touches of iodine, lemon curd, golden flowers and honey on the nose of this dessert wine. It's refreshingly light in body, but with a zesty lemon-skin acidity that cuts through the pear juice and Key-lime rind flavors. It's smooth and balanced.",90,40.0
3434,Siduri,"Shows the impeccably ripe fruitiness and purity that characterize Siduri Pinot Noirs, with the powerful structure of this celebrated vineyard. Dry and fairly tannic, the wine's flavors are of cherry pie filling, red currants, anise liqueur, chocolate and pepper spice. Fabulously hedonistic now, and should slowly build momentum for the next six years.",94,55.0
3435,Testarossa,"A savory nose of seared beef crust gets lift from violet and lavender florals, and then the wine coats the palate very softly, with luscious flavors of stewed cherry, ripe cranberry and more herb-crusted roast. A licorice-aided acidity cleans the mouth on the finish.",93,61.0
3436,Bründlmayer,"There is a distinct nutty smoky impression on the nose. The concentrated palate also comes with shades of vanilla and hazelnut, wrapping its fresh lemon and herbal spice into a warming intriguing cloak. It is the purity of the lemon that shines and lasts longest on the palate. This may be a bit young to drink now, so be patient and drink 2020–2030.",93,80.0
3437,Bründlmayer,"Funky yeast still holds sway on the nose. Underneath that are notions of ripe juicy pear and a soft hint of vanilla. The palate strikes a sonorous balance between smoky vanilla and gently peppered pears. There is concentration and promise. The finish is nutty and very long. This is still tightly closed and needs to unfurl, but will become a great gastronomic wine. Drink 2019–2025.",93,50.0
3438,Fess Parker,"Nice and easy aromas of lemon sorbet, Gravenstein apple and jasmine emerge from this ever-reliable bottling from the late actor-turned-vintner's family winery. The flavors are also straightforward and quite quaffable, with a light acidity framing apple flesh and Anjou-pear slices.",88,19.0
3439,Iron Horse,"A portion of the proceeds from sales of this dry sparkler helps support marine protected areas and sustainable fishing. Tart and doughy, it imparts a bite of vanilla biscuit, apple pie, orange peel and lime. A streak of minerality gives it plenty of life atop the medium body.",92,50.0
3440,Williams Selyem,"This is the inaugural vintage of a new estate wine, from a 30-acre property on Eastside Road across the Russian River from the winery. Pear compote, anise and lemon candy wrap around voluptuous layers marked by green apple and orange peel, offering richness and weight in hearty measure.",92,65.0
3441,Wines & Winemakers,"With six years' aging, this is a delicious, soft and mature wine. The fruit and acidity have been subsumed into a balsam and spice flavored wine, with a touch of mint and sweet chocolate. It is delicious now, not for aging further.",92,20.0
3442,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"The restrained and floral opening of jasmine and mandarin peel leads to a palate that holds just a touch of residual sugar, filling this gorgeously balanced Gewurztraminer to the brim with sweet citrus swirls of tangerine, satsuma and mandarin. Notes of orange blossom hover and are pulled into focus by the textured mouthfeel of this immensely elegant wine.",93,55.0
3443,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"Very ripe, red-cheeked Mirabelles and orange peel represent the aromatic top notes. With more air, mandarin juice becomes apparent, and the palate is wonderfully taut and concentrated. There is a haunting purity and a strong undertow of earth and stone that soars on the long finish.",93,55.0
3444,Iron Horse,"Formidable acidity gives this lovely wine a freshness around complementary layers of rose petal and strawberry-pomegranate. Made from a blend of two Chardonnay clones, it adds additional notes of tangerine and lemon-lime on the lengthy, complex finish.",93,50.0
3445,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"Big, firm and dense, this is a powerful wine, with dark tannins that give a dry, concentrated character. The juicy plum and damson fruit flavors, along with the fresh aftertaste, will be a delicious balance as the wine develops. Drink from 2020.",93,260.0
3446,Louis Latour,"This wine has a firm structure, solid with tannins and a dense, complex balance between acidity and perfumed red berry flavors. It is juicy, full of freshness as well as considerable tannins. It needs to be aged for several years; drink from 2019.",92,120.0
3447,Iron Horse,"Available in magnum only, this is an occasional bottling from the winery. A winery spokeperson told me my bottle was entirely 1993 vintage, but not all other bottles are. The wine is extraordinarily fine, but compared to other California bubblies, it's sandpapery and almost harsh at this point. As it warms up in the glass it shows an immense toasted nut and grilled fruit richness with an impossibly long finish. This is one to stash for the long haul.",97,147.0
3448,Chanson Père et Fils,"This is a very taut wine from the poorest soil in the Clos des Mouches Vineyard. This tastes of citrus fruit, with a powerful, spicy, complex finish that promises good aging.",92,112.0
3449,Chanson Père et Fils,"Opulent and ripe, but at the same time it shows red fruits, fresh acids and a structured core. It has a wonderful, generous finish that showcases the rich fruits and warm tannins.",92,112.0
3450,Louis Latour,"Concentrated, dense and powerful, this has all the structure of a Chambertin. As a contrast, the juicy acidity cuts through the texture, luring out black fruits that balance the solid core of tannins. It needs to age for at least seven years.",92,260.0
3451,DFJ Vinhos,"A soft, creamy wine full of apple and pear fruits that are edged with crisp acidity. It is ripe, but still young; drink this attractive wine from 2017.",87,13.0
3452,DFJ Vinhos,"A big, burly, juicy wine, focusing on powerful red fruits and layers of acidity. The tannins are dense, but the fruit is more dominant. There are smoky flavors, spiked with licorice and blueberries. Caladoc is a cross between Malbec and Grenache, developed in France, rarely planted.",87,
3453,Fess Parker,"The late actor-turned-vintner's family keeps producing solid wines, including this bottling that offers earthy scents of beet juice and clove. The flavors are pomegranate-driven, with cardamom and allspice making the wine memorable and lasting on the finish.",93,55.0
3454,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"The Corton hill has a number of red Grand Cru sites, including Vergennes, which lies at the western end. The wine has power, although its more dominant character is richness. It's packed with red fruits, laced with dark tannins and spice, and freshened with black currant acidity. It's a wine for aging, drink from 2018.",93,200.0
3455,Louis Jadot,"Part of the domaine of the Gagey family that runs Louis Jadot, this dense, wood-dominated wine has an austere character at this stage. Ripe, potentially full of yellow and creamy white fruits, it will always have a serious side. Drink from 2018.",93,75.0
3456,Lynmar,"This inaugural vintage of Monastery shows a complex intermingling of herb and briny cheese rind along with soft and generous Asian spice and brambly blackberries. The savory characteristics persist into black tea and subtle black pepper, all the while accented by just-bloomed rose.",93,70.0
3457,Lynmar,"This is the winery's first Kanzler Vineyard Pinot Noir and its only Sonoma Coast appellation Pinot. The cool-climate vineyard offers ripe cherry and plum around a core of firm, velvety tannins. From there, vibrant cranberry and rhubarb flirt with black tea, while red apple, sage and sandalwood notes round out the flavors on the long finish.",92,70.0
3458,Iron Horse,"Made to commemorate the sparkling wine the winery produced for the Reagan-Gorbachev Summit Meetings in the 1980s, this blends 74% Pinot Noir and 26% Chardonnay in a richer style, still dry, and just recently disgorged in July 2014. Complex and creamy, it offers a seductive nose of ripe apple and custard, the flavors following through in a medium-weight, mellowed way.",92,38.0
3459,Louis Latour,"This perfumed wine features ripe tannins and strawberry flavors. It is structured, with good concentration and acidity. The wine is developing well with the richness as well as line of fresher acidity. Drink from 2019.",89,80.0
3460,Columbia Crest,"There is plenty of color and extract in this tannic wine. Blackberry fruit is at the core, and though aged in one third new oak, it is not evident in the flavors. A balanced and beautifully proportioned wine, which accurately captures the AVA's strengths.",89,15.0
3461,Robert Mondavi,"From the winery's signature vineyard and old Sauvignon Blanc vines, originally planted in 1959, this wine offers complexity and intrigue. Flavors range from crisp lemon to savory fennel and herb, a long, lingering finish sealing the deal.",89,40.0
3462,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Almost indistinguishable from its companion Horse Heaven Vineyard bottling, the Columbia Valley Sauvignon Blanc also clocks in at a modest 12.5% alcohol. It offers light, succinct, pure varietal flavors, on the cool side with green apple, peavine, and a bracing minerality.",88,13.0
3463,V. Sattui,"Tar and black fruit emerge from the shadows of big tannins that pucker on the palate, begging for more time to soften. Robust and full bodied with a warm ripeness, it finishes flat.",85,65.0
3464,Concha y Toro,"This ripe, dark Maipo Syrah opens with slightly generic aromas of blackberry and black cherry. Rich, resiny and creamy on the palate, this tastes oaky at first; next come roasted spicy blackberry flavors in front of a minty finish with wood-spice notes and barrel-related tannins. Drink through 2021.",91,125.0
3465,Kunde,"From the winery's estate, this wine opens in pretty floral notes of jasmine and orange blossom, following on the full-bodied palate with baked pear and vanilla. It finishes tart and dry.",86,30.0
3466,Santa Ema,"Grassy aromas feature a note of green banana and yeast. This feels round but hardly chunky, with reasonable core acidity. Flavors of citrus and apple are simple and clean, while a lemon-lime note and a hint of honey take care of the ending.",86,14.0
3467,V. Sattui,"This is a dull, hugely tannic wine. It's hard to penetrate, with its robust use of dry oak and heat. The finish delivers a shot of gunpowder and graphite.",83,42.0
3468,Georges Duboeuf,"A step up from Sélection in the Moulin-à-Vent range from Duboeuf, this wine has been aged in oak for six months. The result is a ripe, smoothly textured wine, its cherry fruits offering an attractive smoky character. It could do with a year, even two, for aging.",89,
3469,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"Chorey-lès-Beaune, on the plain just north of Beaune, can offer—as here—good value for Burgundy. This wine, still showing some young austerity, has the potential to develop into a bold, fruity selection that will always have a firmer structured edge.",89,43.0
3470,Georges Duboeuf,This is a fresh wine that also has a strong sense of structure. It's textured with white fruits coming through a nervy acidity and minerality. Hints of wood are tantalizing and round the wine out at the end.,89,
3471,Columbia Crest,"The reserve is still tightly wound, but expressive, with firm, focused flavors of cassis fruit, backed with a refreshing minerality. Chewy and stylish, its briary fruits carry through a long, sculpted finish with light accents of herb.",91,45.0
3472,Louis Jadot,"Very smoky aromas, the fruit ripe with sweet blackberry flavors. The wood is still very present, not yet completely integrated; there is a touch of green perhaps from the wood. At the same time, the wine is developing while keeping a fresh streak of acidity.",92,
3473,Georges Duboeuf,"As rich as it is tannic, this is powerful and concentrated. It shows the rich 2009 fruit at its best, full of sweet berries, deliciously ripe. Enjoyable, while it is also serious.",92,
3474,Louis Jadot,"This rich, firmly structured wine comes from a nine-acre vineyard close to the village of Pommard. Its ripe black fruits are just starting to show through the dry core. Concentrated and powerful, it will be best from 2022.",92,79.0
3475,Montes,"Good but common as Chilean Cabs go. It's a jumbled mass of bulky fruit, raw power, sweet oak and spice. The mouthfeel is tannic, grabby and big, while the flavors of black cherry and raspberry are nice but generic. Finishes with spice and a hint of hickory. 20,000 cases produced.",86,12.0
3476,Wines & Winemakers,A strange orange-pink color for a wine that is somewhere between fruity and sweet and acid and bitter. This one hasn't found a balance.,82,12.0
3477,Robert Mondavi,"A lovely Merlot, light and spicy. It has pretty flavors of cherries, mocha and cinnamon, with fine, ripe tannins, with a sweetness from glycerine. An elegant Merlot at a good price.",89,21.0
3478,Williams Selyem,"Quite a good Zinfandel, although it does show some of the weaknesses that strike this vineyard in a cool year. You'll find a smooth, full-bodied wine, with ample tannins and fine berry-cherry fruit and spices. Yet it's curiously ambiguous in the mouth, and the concentration falls apart midpalate.",87,50.0
3479,DFJ Vinhos,"In his continual quest for unusual blends, DFJ winemaker José Neiva has come up with this mix of the Vinho Verde grape Alvarinho and Chardonnay. When it is young, as here, the fresh, crisp Alvarinho dominates, giving lively, vibrant green-fruit flavors. Some weight underneath hints at the Chardonnay.",88,
3480,Fess Parker,"This tastes somewhat vegetal, with dill and asparagus hints that are set against the cherry pie flavor.",83,30.0
3481,Fess Parker,"Green and mint-like in scent, with a note that's reminiscent of grape stem, this Pinot Noir tastes hot from the high alcohol.",82,55.0
3482,Montes,"This opaque Carmenère opens with oaky, charred aromas of black fruits, coconut and burnt toast. The palate is full, meandering and ultimately heavy and extracted. Dark, toasty flavors of black fruits, resiny oak and vanilla finish with grabby tannins, spiky acidity and long-lasting blackened notes.",88,22.0
3483,Siduri,"Intensely dark blackberry fruit meets with game and minty chocolate on the nose of this appellation blend by Adam Lee. The flavors are woody with forest undergrowth, and surround a core of mulberry.",88,39.0
3484,Georges Duboeuf,"This is a solid, structured, mineral-driven wine from a famous vineyard. It is firm and dense, its big plum and berry flavors are supported by dry tannins and an herbal spice character. With its firm style, it needs to age for at least two years.",90,
3485,Georges Duboeuf,"Firm tannins and its dark plum and blackberry fruits all point to a structured wine that has aging potential. It is ripe, with black cherry and spice notes that are balanced with acidity. Keep for one year.",90,
3486,Kendall-Jackson,"Soft and supple, this wine aims to please across a wide range of palates, offering mellowed tannins and oak around a layering of plum, cherry and cinnamon.",86,24.0
3487,Williams Selyem,"Amazingly rich, one of the most opulent Chardonnays you can drink now. Just wows the mouth with pineapple, pear, exotic tropical fruit, crème brûlée, vanilla custard, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors that go on and on through the finish. Also shows fine, tart acidity, which provides needed balance. Yes, it's superripe, but this is what California Chardonnay does at its best.",95,50.0
3488,Iron Horse,"This is a very rich Chardonnay. It has complex, lush flavors of pineapples, lemons, limes, oranges and the smoky vanilla notes from 100% new oak. High acidity fortunately provides crisp balance. Almost too much of a good thing, it calls for equally rich fare, such as lobster or Ahi tuna tartare.",92,46.0
3489,Testarossa,"Made of equal parts ultraripe pineapple and exotic lime fruit, coupled with sweet, smoky crème brûlée and buttered toast from oak and lees stirring, this is a super-rich Chardonnay. Don't drink it too cold; it matures and knits together as it breathes in the glass.",92,44.0
3490,Testarossa,"Made in a leaner, acidic, minerally style, this bone-dry wine feels ultra-clean and distinguished in the mouth. It's austere, but you'll find a core of pineapples, apples and limes. Great with a shellfish-inspired risotto. Elegant and food-friendly, it should develop over the next 4–5 years.",92,39.0
3491,Kunde,"This is a big-boned and soft wine with pleasing characteristics of blackberry, vanilla wafer and upfront baking spice. The tannins are well-managed and integrated, with a touch of sweet heat on the finish.",86,22.0
3492,Montes,"Varietally and regionally correct, with green, grassy, punchy aromas of citrus, white pepper and jalapeño. This is prickly in the mouth, with lively acidity and flavors of lime, scallion, green apple and bell pepper. It finishes with cut and juicy acids.",87,12.0
3493,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Enticing scents of red berry violet and menthol lift from the glass. On the bright polished palate, juicy morello cherry, blackberry, licorice and a sprinkling of white pepper are set against vibrant acidity and lithe athletic tannins. Drink through 2019.",89,19.0
3494,Concha y Toro,"Cheesy smelling oak and slightly overripe fruit aromas are a little less than spotless on the nose. In the mouth, this is raw and saucy in feel, with biting tannins. Sauvage berry flavors are gamy, while this is drying, scratchy and rugged on the finish. Drink through 2022.",89,26.0
3495,Chanson Père et Fils,"Lovely perfumed fruit with delicious, soft sweetness, raspberry and sweet plums. The acidity attractively cuts through this ripeness.",89,
3496,Robert Mondavi,"This value-driven wine has a touch of spearmint and bay leaf on the nose, and remains savory and herbal on the palate. A bit of heft builds around black cherry and raspberry, ending seamlessly with only the faintest taste of toasted oak.",89,28.0
3497,Wines & Winemakers,"Old vines on schist soil have produced a wine that is so concentrated. It is spoilt by some bitter extract that comes from wood aging as much as from the fruit. If that softens, the wine will become rich and generous. Wait until 2017.",87,18.0
3498,Trapiche,"Opening aromas of cola and dark fruits are belied by the tangy, edgy palate that's fresh in terms of its raspberry and plum flavors but not all that deep or complex. A clean, straightforward wine with zest but limited flavors.",85,12.0
3499,DFJ Vinhos,"Creamy, green plum- and wood-flavored Chardonnay, clean, somewhat anonymous. Hints of citrus and acidity help keep the wine fresh, giving a final, easy crisp finish.",85,13.0
3500,Georges Duboeuf,"The cru wine is soft, full of cherry fruits and with a light touch of tannin. With its fruit, it is open and generous with a crisp aftertaste. Drink now.",87,20.0
3501,Louis Latour,"Very firm and tight, with streaks of mineral and textures of earth. Unyielding and a bit over-sulfered, but it hints and depth and concentration.",89,48.0
3502,Robert Mondavi,"A little prune, cherry and tobacco mix on the nose with some leafiness, creating a bouquet similar to Bordeaux. Black cherry and licorice are the predominant flavors, and in the end game there's a subdued coffee-tinged, reserved character to it.",89,45.0
3503,Louis Latour,"Scents of pineapple and hazelnuts open into a lush, spicy, forward, slightly toasty wine with immediate drinkablility and appeal.",88,40.0
3504,Louis Latour,"Richly scented with citrus blossoms, mineral and spice. Nicely balanced and light, the flavors are layered and intermingled through an elegant, firm, satisfying finish.",88,45.0
3505,Albert Bichot,"With some firm structure, this wine also has great fruitiness. It offers plenty of raspberry fruits, good acidity and a solid texture of tannins. The acidity keeps the wine perfumed and fresh. Drink the wine from 2019.",90,80.0
3506,Chanson Père et Fils,"Aromas of this wine show considerable wood. On the palate, the wood is very present, giving acidity as well as layers of toast and spice. Hints of yellow fruit show through, suggesting the possibility of a ripe, rich wine in the future. Drink from 2019.",90,59.0
3507,Columbia Crest,"Light aromas of rose petal, herb and spice lead to dry, white grapefruit flavors that fall a bit flat.",84,28.0
3508,Kunde,"What does “briary” mean? Think about a wild black raspberry bush on a hot summer afternoon. The wood, the bark, the dust, the chlorophyll from the baking leaves and the berries, with that wild, primitive, spicy, fructose-sweet bitterness. This wine is bone dry and finishes with a tannic bite. Drink it now with sturdy chow.",86,25.0
3509,V. Sattui,"This aromatic wine does a great job of combining effusive fruit with a lively balance. Beautiful orange blossom and honeysuckle aromas blend into delicious apple flavors while a tangy, lemon-zest sensation lights up the texture.",90,23.0
3510,V. Sattui,"A medium-sweet wine with 2.19% residual sugar, this has a sweetness like ripe white peach topped by a honeysuckle rose, but it remains light and never cloying. The nutty finish begs for blue cheese.",90,24.0
3511,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Notes of olive, herbs, flowers, orange peel, gravel, meat, coffee and light barrel spices leap up on a wine that shows a lot of aromatic complexity. The fruit and savory flavors are plush and full in feel followed by a lingering finish. There's a whole lot of wine delivered for this price.",90,15.0
3512,Columbia Crest,"This blend of Cabernet Franc (52%) along with Syrah (38%), Cabernet Sauvignon (8%) and 2% Merlot saw just a smidgeon (10%) of new oak. Notes of dried herbs, raspberries and dark chocolate partner with lithe fruit flavors backed by grainy tannins.",88,12.0
3513,Columbia Crest,"The oak makes the largest impression on this wine, with the notes of vanilla and butterscotch out in front of apple and apricot. It's creamy in feel, trailing slightly toward the finish.",88,12.0
3514,Casa Santos Lima,"Bright and fruity, this is a ripe, red-fruit-flavored wine. The youthful tannins will soften quickly to give a rounded wine, rich but with crisp acidity at the end. Drink now.",87,15.0
3515,Wines & Winemakers,"Made by Leonor Freitas in the family winery, this is a rich blend of Castelão, Touriga Nacional and Syrah. With its firm tannins balanced by juicy red fruit, it's a wine to savor from early 2018.",86,12.0
3516,Wines & Winemakers,"This state-owned estate of forests and vineyards grows organic grapes. This wine, softly structured and ripe has light black fruits and plenty of acidity. An undercurrent of tannin keeps the wine in order and will allow it to age. Drink from 2018.",86,12.0
3517,Bründlmayer,"One of the entry-level wines from Bründlmayer, this is all about the fruit. It is fresh and perfumed, with just a touch of pepper that adds zestiness. It's a pleasure to drink now, and the creamed pear and citrus flavors are already in harmony.",88,23.0
3518,Chehalem,"This smoky, dusty wine seems to be chugging quickly along the aging curve. At the moment, it's drinking nicely, decked out with pretty baking spice and mocha highlights. It's smooth and mouth filling, with lots of pretty cherry flavor.",88,27.0
3519,Columbia Crest,"From the use of the term Shiraz (rather than Syrah) to the sweet, vanilla-and-tobacco-laden flavors, this seems to be aimed squarely at the consumer who loves a forward, round and rather soft Australian-style wine. It delivers ripe berry flavors, silky tannins and plenty of up-front pleasure for the price.",86,11.0
3520,DFJ Vinhos,"There is an attractive mint character to this wine, that follows through to a juicy fruit character with a ripe blackberry jam flavor. The acidity keeps the whole wine soft, sweet and fresh.",86,10.0
3521,DFJ Vinhos,"On the face of it, this is an unlikely combination. But the ripeness of the Chardonnay and crisper, perfumed Alvarinho go well together, a wine that shows richness and lightness, as well as pear and lemon flavors. The finishing acidity is very refreshing.",86,10.0
3522,Wines & Winemakers,"All the warm southern heat of the Alentejo is in this wine. It is rich, generous and full of ripe, black fruits. Berries and juicy damsons are spiced with pepper, rich tannins and lifted by acidity. It is a wine for big meat dishes, for stews, a powerful, no-holds-barred style. It will be ready to drink from 2017.",90,40.0
3523,Kunde,"There's a mix of sweetness and greenness to this wine, a 100% varietal that is somewhat dull and unformed on the palate. It finishes slightly sour.",83,23.0
3524,Wines & Winemakers,"Made from old Douro vines, this wine is dark, almost black, with flavors as dense as its color. While rich, it is also fruity with blackberry flavor, sweet tannins and a cutting edge of acidity to give a lift at the end. Drink until 2020.",90,14.0
3525,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"The Indian Wells Cabernet Sauvignon seems a little reductive at the moment; odd, since the 2005 vintage was forward, almost fat, and the wine has been in bottle for quite some time. It should definitely be decanted and aired out before serving, which will help to push the fruit flavors forward. The finish is just slightly dilute, but the wine is well-made and may just be suffering from some of the occasional dumbness that strikes Cabernet.",86,18.0
3526,Foxen,"Concentrated red cherries, dried purple flowers, fresh rose petals and a wet gravel minerality show on the nose of this bottling by Billy Wathen and Dick Dore. It's light in body and fairly delicate on the sip, with Earl Grey tea, stewed cranberry and rose-hip flavors.",91,38.0
3527,Testarossa,"Mossy, dank, forest-floor aromas of juniper, chaparral shrub, pencil lead and spiced porcini mushrooms mix with a cooked rhubarb character on the nose of this wine from single-vineyard specialist Bill Brosseau. Cranberry and tart cherry flavors are decorated with rainbow peppercorns, herb-crusted roast beef, bay leaf, eucalyptus and camphor, with layers upon layers of complexity.",95,64.0
3528,Bründlmayer,"A rich, nutty note hints at hazelnut, with lively citrus laying underneath. This vein of lemony verve leads the melody like the soaring, unfettered notes of a violin against a sonorous background. This will always be firm but once it opens up, it will be even more harmonious and beguiling. Drink from 2020.",95,74.0
3529,Robert Mondavi,"If you must open this now, let it breath for a while because it’s dumb, as they say, on opening. Airing and swirling reveal more earthy things than fruit. There’s a hint of truffles, of bark, and you almost have to close your eyes to imagine the blackberries and cherries buried deep down inside, but they’re there. You can taste them in the midpalate, and the finish lasts for a long time. Cellar this beauty and drink the regular Mondavi Pinot now and for the next five years.",93,50.0
3530,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"A structured, cool wine that is poised and elegant, it has a lightly creamy texture cut by apple and pear flavors. Definitely mineral, it is textured with fruit skins and flavored with the oak aging. It needs to be aged, so don't drink before 2016.",89,57.0
3531,Louis Latour,This attractive village wine has ripe fruits as well as a more steely texture. Wood flavors give smoothness that rounds out the wine and enhances the yellow fruit flavors. Drink now.,89,80.0
3532,Louis Latour,"With its tannins, the wine is firm, tight and dark. The black fruit flavors are just beginning to come through. It has power and structure and certainly needs to age. Drink from 2017.",88,95.0
3533,Maryhill,"The aromas of basil, blueberry and char aren't entirely in harmony on this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah and Cabernet Franc. The fruit flavors come together better, sweet and palate-coating with a pleasing intensity.",86,12.0
3534,Santa Ema,"Tarry black-cherry aromas are a bit damp, oaky and scratchy, but overall this opens well. A solid, firm, edgy palate offers flavors of herbal blackberry and baked black plum, while the finish is meaty and a touch salty.",86,10.0
3535,Wines & Winemakers,"A big, bold and ripe wine, this is rich and packed with dark fruits. Firm tannins are well cushioned by the berry fruits and the acidity. It is a generous wine that comes from the region south of Lisbon. Aged in wood for 12 months, it is now ready to drink.",91,40.0
3536,Williams Selyem,"A delicate expression of power and beauty, this conveys kirsch cherry, wet stone and high-toned minerality. Round and easy to love, it offers a subtle streak of tannin and tight, integrated oak, finishing in dark chocolate and orange.",93,58.0
3537,Williams Selyem,"A struggle between screaming acidity and subtle, salty oak provide a tension of freshness to this wine. It teases in tangerine and jasmine before giving way to more comforting characteristics of honeyed tea and baked pear. The minerality balances a full and strong body.",93,65.0
3538,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Ros'Aura is one of the most delightful rosatos to come from southern Italy. It's a concentrated bright pink color, with fresh aromas of wild berry and pink grapefruit.",89,15.0
3539,Lynmar,"With fine acidity, grippy tannins and a tangy minerality, this Pinot offers complex flavors of sour-cherry candy, red currant, Dr. Pepper and spice that are laced with notes of dried herbs and white pepper. Turns dramatic on the midpalate, where the weight sinks in. Delicious now, this should develop over the next 6–8 years.",95,70.0
3540,Lynmar,"Lots of toasty new oak marks this Chardonnay, as well as bright, citrusy acidity. It's young, vibrant and energetic, and undoubtedly complex. Beginning with flavors of Meyer lemons, apricots and limes, it evolves in the glass with flavors of minerals, white flowers and honey. This should last six years or so.",94,70.0
3541,Lynmar,"This is a concentrated wine, with intense flavors of cherry and red currant. There's a tug of the earth by way of minerals and dried herbs. It's splendid acidity and firm tannins give it wonderful structure. It's an ager, so it should hold out at least through 2017.",94,70.0
3542,Montes,"Cool-climate pyrazinic aromas are punchy and feline. This feels good but weaker and more dilute than in most years. Briny, pickled citrus flavors follow the nose, while this ends lean and green but solid enough.",86,13.0
3543,Montes,"Smells like an ocean breeze mixed with field greens, citrus and passion fruit. Montes has been a leader in Chile's movement toward coastal SB, and this one is blasting with grapefruit, green apple, passion fruit and minerality. In the mouth, it has some weight and richness; but that's balanced by zippy acidity. Can't imagine a better match for ceviche or tuna tartare.",90,16.0
3544,Concha y Toro,"At over $20 the brand's Best Buy days are behind it, but this Cabernet still unfolds in serious but elegant form. The nose is dusty and dark, with cassis and blackberry aromas. Meanwhile, the feel is juicy and fresh, and the palate is just sizable enough. Flavors of cassis, chocolate and coconut are modern and friendly, while the finish of cocoa, mocha and marmalade is exciting.",90,21.0
3545,Santa Ema,"Rich, chocolaty, toasty aromas of lactic oak and vanilla match red-fruit scents of raspberry and strawberry. This is lively on the palate, with an acidic pulse. Flavors of raw oak, creamy vanilla, plum and boysenberry finish overtly woody, with a lasting flavor of oak grain. Drink through 2018.",89,24.0
3546,Feudi di San Gregorio,"This is a very special, one-of-a-kind sparkling wine. Made in the metodo classico with indigenous Greco grapes (from the southern Italian region of Campania) the wine rests on the lees for 24 months to achieve extra richness and opulence on the nose and mouth. Ripe aromas of peach, melon and almond rise to the forefront.",90,45.0
3547,Feudi di San Gregorio,"This is a really fantastic wine and one of the best expression of Falanghina available today. (Perhaps the best.) What sets it apart is the purity of its fruit aromas. Citrus, white mineral and tonic fruit aromas hint at the crisp and smooth palate.  Would wash down well with fish, salad or spaghetti con vongole.",90,33.0
3548,Siduri,"A good Pinot Noir, lusty, dry and fruity, although it's a bit raw in youth. Shows rich cherry marmalade, cola, spice and sandalwood flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. The vineyard is not among the valley's best, but Siduri interprets it as well as anyone.",90,50.0
3549,Williams Selyem,"There is a rich black plum darkness to the nose of this bottling, which transitions to muddy loam and wet clay, lifted by aromatic sagebrush. The palate shows dried black cherry, star anise and more soil-driven minerality.",91,58.0
3550,Foxen,"A great success, especially given the difficulties of the vintage. With a modest alcohol reading of 13.8% by volume, it's exuberantly ripe in cherries and umami-filled red currants, with oak adding just the right notes of toast. Delicious now, but this is a Pinot that wants some age. Even better after 2017.",93,58.0
3551,Trapiche,"Like almost every wine in Trapiche's single-vineyard Malbec series, Ambrosia is concentrated and deep, with potent aromas of wood smoke, lemon peel, blackberry and tar. This feels layered and plush, while flavors of wild berry, dark spices, coffee and mocha finish with a blast of chocolate and nutmeg. Drink through 2018.",93,50.0
3552,Siduri,"A bit less intense aromatically than other Adam Lee bottlings, this shows sour plum, smoked meat and a touch of garden herbs on the nose. Those elements come alive on the palate, where peppercorns, oregano, thyme and pencil lead decorate dark cranberry fruits.",90,49.0
3553,Trapiche,"Minty blackberry aromas come with a giant scoop of oak and a touch of graphite. This is lively, ripe and a touch acidic, with dark-fruit flavors and freshness courtesy of ringing acids. The finish shows size and moderate sophistication.",87,15.0
3554,Bründlmayer,"Despite its maturity, this still has fresh pear and grapefruit flavors, which combine with almond, cream and currant notes, producing a round, smooth wine.",88,
3555,Testarossa,"From the vineyard planted by the Pisoni and Franscioni families, this wine delivers bright raspberry and strawberry aromas with sweet star anise spice. The medium-bodied palate is lively and boisterous, with ripe cranberry, tangy red plum skin and sour cherry flavors, accented with a helping of dried herbs.",93,65.0
3556,Fess Parker,"Rich red cherry, rhubarb and alpine strawberry aromas meet rust and shaved licorice on the nose of this beautiful bottling from the Parker family's cool-climate vineyard. It's deceptively light on the palate, with airy flavors that intensify to exotic cherry, mulberry, tea leaf and maduro cigar, framed by firm, structured tannins. Drink 2020–2024.",93,55.0
3557,Louis Latour,"This wine is firm and structured, with dark tannins and a dense texture that is still dry. It offers ripe fruit as well as acidity, currently overshadowed by the tannins but will come to the fore with some time. The wine will age well, thanks to the solid structure and dry core of tannins. Drink from 2020.",91,90.0
3558,Louis Latour,"This wine is pure and fruity, with a strong, tight line of minerality. It is perfumed with apple and grapefruit flavors and a light touch of wood, with good acidity at the end. Drink from 2017.",91,90.0
3559,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Pear, butter and spice aromas lead to tingly, broad-feeling flavors that are straight down the fairway.",86,11.0
3560,Maryhill,"The pear, nectarine and floral aromas seem to lack clarity. This wine is full of stone-fruit flavors that bring a touch of sweetness and lead to a warm finish.",86,18.0
3561,V. Sattui,"This light-bodied, aromatic wine smells like roses and a bowl of fresh fruit. Flavors are lightly sweet and peachy, the texture tangy and the finish sugary.",86,26.0
3562,Concha y Toro,"Black cherry, blackberry, olive and gritty oak aromas feed into a scratchy palate with forceful acidity. Oaky, blackened flavors of medicinal berry fruits finish with notes of mint and carob. Overall, this is solid but typically herbal and saucy.",86,11.0
3563,Undurraga,"This light-colored, almost clear, SB opens with pungent, fairly sharp aromas of sea brine and sweaty citrus fruits. In the mouth, this is tight, edgy and pointy due to blazing acidity. Citrus, bell pepper and green-herb flavors finish peppery and with scouring acidity.",87,15.0
3564,Montes,"Rubbery black-fruit aromas are heavily oaked, so much so that this Cabernet-Carmenère blend smells charred but also like plastic. A big grabby palate is jagged in feel, while this tastes like the nose suggests, meaning oaky, herbal and like berry fruits and plum. A woody finish is short on total integration.",87,16.0
3565,Montes,"Dusty raspberry and plum aromas show a note of Band-Aid. This feels creamy and full, with black cherry, chocolate and oak flavors. An oaky essence carries onto the finish, which is chunky and lasting.",87,16.0
3566,Concha y Toro,"Setting a new high bar for Carmenère is this luxury version from Concha y Toro's Cachapoal vineyard. And while it deserves to be drunk sooner than later, we recommend it for the best steak you grill this year. It's a strapped, juicy wine with tons of coffee, chocolate and berry essence. It's too hard or layered, so get at it soon for its up-front fruit and character.",92,74.0
3567,Concha y Toro,"In recent years, with winemaker Enrique Tirado firmly at the helm, Don Melchor has gotten better and better. And while 2004 was an average year in Chile, this ranks as the best Melchor we've sampled. The wine has beautiful blackberry, cola and pepper aromas in front of cassis, cherry, plum, nutmeg and cinnamon flavors. It's brawny but balanced, with excellent natural acidity. Best from 2008–2012.",92,50.0
3568,Montes,"On the nose, there are cider, oak and baked corn notes. The palate is full of oak and resin flavors that prevent the fruit from emerging immediately. It tastes of hickory, apple and melon on the palate and finish.",86,22.0
3569,Undurraga,"Piercing black cherry and cassis aromas are a touch rustic and massive, but hey, that's old-vines Carignan from Maule (this one also contains 12% Cinsault). So saturated that it's beastly on the palate, this tastes of hard-rolling blackberry and black plum. Plenty of gritty spice, tomato and integrated oak fill out the menu. Drink through 2025.",92,35.0
3570,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"A bright dash of lemon is colored with a hint of yeast and flint. The palate, which brims with ripe Amalfi lemon notes, also has that slight flinty stony touch. But it is the lemon that characterizes the compact, precise and dry body. It is the zestiness that brightens and enlivens. Very refreshing, with wonderful balance and tension. Drink now through 2027.",92,40.0
3571,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"Both amplitude and generosity are apparent from the first sniff with ripe pear dominating the flavor spectrum. The body is concentrated and balances the full fruit with pleasant tingling zestiness. This is dry and precisely drawn, with a zesty finish.",92,26.0
3572,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"Grapefruit and quince make for an exciting opening amidst some yeasty notes. On the palate, aromatic quince and plum notes reflect the generosity of the vintage while remaining dry and light-bodied. There is an ease here, of drinking and thinking, of sipping and being refreshed. This goes down far too easily on deceptively light feet. The finish is of refreshing lemon zest.",92,26.0
3573,Bründlmayer,"Funky yeast still holds sway on the nose. Underneath that are notions of ripe juicy pear and a soft hint of vanilla. The palate strikes a sonorous balance between smoky vanilla and gently peppered pears. There is concentration and promise. The finish is nutty and very long. This is still tightly closed and needs to unfurl, but will become a great gastronomic wine. Drink 2019–2025.",93,50.0
3574,Bründlmayer,"A haze of hazelnut and wood smoke envelopes the poised concentrated lemon and green-pear fruit on the palate. There is incisive freshness and a concentrated core with a downright lip-smacking finish. It would be a waste to drink this now when everything about this bundled, energetic wine still needs to unfurl. Give this time. Drink 2020–2030.",93,70.0
3575,Testarossa,"Winemaker Bill Brosseau tapped into his family's vineyard to produce this light and delicate wine. Its aromas suggest white flowers, key lime and chalk, while its flavors are high-toned and tight, recalling chilled pear, lime and pomelo pith. A graphite-like minerality adds complexity.",92,49.0
3576,Siduri,"Offering considerable weight and depth of flavor, this Pinot, from one of the most respected vineyards in the appellation, offers mid-term aging prospects. Dry and spicy, it offers powerful flavors of grilled cherries, red currants, licorice, cola and smoky oak. Drink now through 2012.",92,54.0
3577,Lynmar,"Dark pink in color, this wine is marked by a nutty layering of light acidity and orange, Gravenstein apple and cherry flavors. It's delicate yet has enough stuffing and structure to pair with a wide array of dishes.",91,25.0
3578,Testarossa,"The winery's best-barrel bottling of Chardonnay, this excels on all fronts, showing lemon peels, browned butter, creamy lily and pan-seared apples on the light, crisp yet savory nose. The mouthfeel is rich but decorated with zesty line of salty acidity that cuts through the lemon-curd flavors. Altogether mouthwatering, it's perfect for a seaside meal.",94,70.0
3579,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"The perfumed scent of ripe, red-cheeked Mirabelle plums is joined by some lovely bitter notes of fir honey. The palate shows the typical 2014 freshness, adding passion fruit, pear peel, honeycomb and grapefruit pith to this aromatic tableau. In between, seams of pepper and honeysuckle are highlighted by bright, zesty acidity. The wine offers an irresistible contradiction of structure and enthusiasm.",93,55.0
3580,Siduri,"This wine by Adam Lee shows concentrated touches of nutmeg, crushed pepper and dried thyme laid across a base of hearty blackberries, with dried leaves on the nose. There is a strong herbal component to the sip, with eucalyptus oil and black-pepper dust spicing up the hearty beet juice and black-fruit core. A strong menthol lift arises on the finish.",93,60.0
3581,Testarossa,"This single-vineyard-focused winery controls four specific vineyards as monopole bottlings. This is one, showing black cherry, vanilla bean, nutmeg and a stony slate component on the nose. There is a soft density to the sip, with cranberries, graphite flakes and a sandalwood touch to the palate.",93,64.0
3582,Testarossa,"Winemaker Bill Brousseau works to restrain the powerful ripeness that can come from one of the more famous vineyards in the appellation. This offers a nose with wound-up cranberry fruit, touches of hibiscus and rosebuds, and chipped-slate aromas. The palate shows juniper and pine-needle spice across a juicy black-cherry and black-plum core, with strong acidity and solid structure extending into a savory finish.",93,66.0
3583,Testarossa,"Apple cream, squeezed tangerine and a touch of popcorn make for nice, easy and yet layered aromas on the nose of this bottling by the Los Gatos-based single-vineyard-focused winery. Flavors of Gravenstein apples, browned butter and toast pop on the palate, where an intriguing flinty character pushes this into another level.",93,48.0
3584,Testarossa,"A brawny bottling from one of the state's most historic vineyards, this wine offers wild berries, turned earth, shiitake mushrooms and a light cinnamon glaze on the hearty nose. Rich cherry and plum fruit shows on the tip of the sip followed by rising waves of anise, eucalyptus and white sage. The mouthfeel is soft but with aggressive acidity.",93,64.0
3585,DFJ Vinhos,"Dense and textured, this is a tannin dominated wine. The black fruit is still developing through the firm structure. At the end, with juicy blackberry fruits, the wine shows its generous future. Drink from 2017.",88,9.0
3586,DFJ Vinhos,This blend of Shiraz and Castelão is in a soft and ripe rosé style. There is just a touch of tannin from the Shiraz to give weight. The aftertaste is lightly sweet.,85,8.0
3587,V. Sattui,"This is a little too heavy and full bodied, but it's bone dry and rich in blackberry and currant flavors, with an earthiness that suggests mushrooms. Drink over the next year or two.",86,29.0
3588,Kunde,"Another sweet, oaky Chardonnay joins the ever-growing line. Not that it's an indifferent wine. This family produces nothing but impeccably tailored wines, and this one is among the best of class at this price point. —S.H.",87,16.0
3589,Chanson Père et Fils,"Ripe and soft, here is a Chanson white that hasn't been overwhelmed by wood. Instead, the delicious yellow and white stone fruits come through, with a creamy edge reminiscent of buttered English muffins, finishing on a high note of juicy, thirst-quenching acidity.",92,115.0
3590,Testarossa,"With a nose approaching butterscotch but expertly cut with acidity and cinnamon spice, this is the best Testarossa single-vineyard Chardonnay of 2012. On the palate, there are lovely flavors of salted caramel and yellow peach, and the wine manages to be simultaneously spicy, sharp and smooth. The finish lingers extra long.",93,45.0
3591,V. Sattui,"This wine also contains small percentages of Petite Sirah and Grenache to good effect, providing a soft and approachable entry of well-balanced black fruit and leather.",88,35.0
3592,Lynmar,"Richness floods the midpalate with flavors of raspberries, cherries, red currants and cola, brightened with crisp, zesty acidity. This is Lynmar's best Freestone Pinot ever, showing the ability of the vineyard to ripen fruit even in a chilly vintage. Exciting and stimulating, it's a wine you want to age for at least six years.",94,60.0
3593,Williams Selyem,"A big, rich, flashy Chardonnay that's designed to impress, and does. Almost too much of a good thing, with massive lemondrop candy, pineapple, lime and kiwi fruit flavors, as well as firm minerality and lots of toasty oak. Drink now with opulent fare, such as shellfish.",92,60.0
3594,Bründlmayer,"Old vines give an extra concentration in this intensely spice- and green plum-flavored wine. With its considerable freshness it should age well, its rounded character likely to develop. For now, enjoy its beautiful purity of fruit.",92,
3595,Columbia Crest,"Light aromas of white peach and flowers are followed by elegantly styled, off-dry stone-fruit flavors. It provides intrigue but doesn't entirely deliver.",87,26.0
3596,Concha y Toro,"On the nose, this Chardonnay smells mostly of oak, with apple and melon notes in the background. Salty oaky flavors mask the wine's fruit, which falls into the stone-fruit category. A barrel-dominated finish with nectarine notes is resiny and salty.",87,22.0
3597,Feudi di San Gregorio,"This offers heady aromas of ripe black-skinned fruit, blue flower and a whiff of tilled earth. On the soft succulent palate, brown pepper and a hint of saline accent fleshy plum and ripe black cherry. It's smooth and easy drinking, with supple tannins.",87,20.0
3598,Santa Ema,"Oaky aromas of graphite, vanilla, berry fruits and plum lead to a firm clampy high-acid palate with oak-rich flavors of spiced plum and currant. Mildly green, minty flavors close out a drawing tight finish.",87,13.0
3599,Robert Mondavi,"From an historic block of the famous vineyard long known as Robert's Block, this white is incredibly complex and concentrated, with richly woven layers of pear, Key lime and peach. A handful of Sémillon is blended in, adding extra oomph and flavor, the finish balanced in acidity and marked by freshness.",92,52.0
3600,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Aromas of smoked meat, mesquite, green olive and tire rubber meld with barrel spice accents. It's soft and supple in feel with abundant savory flavors—an interesting wine that has some edge.",88,15.0
3601,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Consistent with previous bottlings, this is dark, oaky, lush with scents and flavors of butter, toast and roasted nuts. The fruit seems secondary to the parade of butterscotch, brown sugar and spice that comes walloping through the palate. The wine turns slightly bitter in the finish. This is a wine for those who love the California style of Chardonnay.",87,18.0
3602,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"There's a nice, juicy, lip-smacking tang to this Sauv Blanc, like biting into a not quite ripe peach or a lemon drop. It's a good mix of citrus, steel and stone. A small amount of Sémillon in the blend adds weight to the midpalate.",87,
3603,Columbia Crest,"The Grand Estates Chardonnay from Columbia Crest is consistently the most broadly fruity, round and oaky wine in the lineup (outside of the much pricier reserve). Apple, pear and peach fruit dominates, and the sometimes too-present, tarted up flavors of butter and vanilla have been brought back into better proportion in this 2006 bottling. Sure to be a popular style, this is one of the best vintages in the past five years.",87,11.0
3604,Foxen,"A bit hot and indelicate, but very ripe, with currant jam and blackberry pie-filling flavors richly layered with smoky, caramelized oak. Finishes with warm-climate sweetness. From the warm, eastern part of Santa Ynez Valley known as Happy Canyon.",87,50.0
3605,Kunde,"Briny, with a hint of salted caramel, this is a high-toned white wine, refreshing in lemon and pear notes, with a slight suggestion of orange peel that's entirely welcoming. Focused and crisp throughout, it remains vibrant amid a creaminess to the mouthfeel, finishing with the right balance of both.",90,22.0
3606,Louis Latour,"This is soft and rounded, with attractive red plum and berry fruits that bring in acidity and a light tannic character. The wine is ripe, with a dry core surrounded by cherry flavors and fresh acidity. It is not a wine for long aging, drink from 2017.",87,45.0
3607,Columbia Crest,"Hailing from a single-vineyard block planted in 1979, this wine is aromatically reticent with notes of pear and flowers. It drinks off dry with stone- and tree-fruit flavors.",87,26.0
3608,Bründlmayer,"Smoky cinnamon dominates the nose, on the palate where notes of red currant and cranberry become apparent. The palate is tightly gathered in its finely constructed, tannic frame. Time in glass reveals riper cherry fruit at the heart. In two to three years it will mellow and show its true aromatic colors. The substance is evident now, but the aromas bid you to wait. Ready from 2016.",90,63.0
3609,Siduri,"This young wine is finding its way, tight and grippy still, with a strong sense of oak and tannin. Leathery and savory, with a suggestion of the rustic, it offers a crispness of black cherry and plum on the finish. Drink now after a slight decanting.",90,49.0
3610,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"The latest Merlot release from Ethos pushes the alcohol up past 15%, and the wine remains stubbornly closed and tannic, even after several hours of breathing time. Blueberry and cassis fruit are in play, though the tannins take over quickly, leading into a finish with some chalky minerality.",89,42.0
3611,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"This Cabernet Sauvignon blend includes Merlot, Syrah and a small amount of “other,” yielding a well-rounded, ripe wine with lush flavors of blueberry and blackberry. The tangy acids spark a finish of fresh herb, licorice and tobacco.",89,14.0
3612,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"The popular Indian Wells bottling from Chateau Ste. Michelle includes 10% Syrah, sourced from the Wahluke Slope. The combination is a proven winner. This medium-bodied, fruit-forward wine's inviting raspberry and cherry flavors are anchored with well-structured tannins.",89,18.0
3613,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"This lightly aromatic wine offers notes of butterscotch, peach and toasty spices. It's lighter in style with a creamy feel to the stone and tropical fruit flavors.",88,17.0
3614,Columbia Crest,"Aromatically pleasing, this suggests fresh blueberry pie, with a whiff of smoked meat. It's straightforward with huckleberry and mocha flavors, trailing slightly toward the finish.",88,12.0
3615,Trapiche,"Cola, blackberry and dusty aromas amount to something nice and inviting. Cab Franc is new to the Broquel lineup, and this is lush, bold and fruity in style, with blackberry, black cherry and mocha flavors in front of a toasty, full-throttle finish.",90,18.0
3616,Testarossa,"There's lots of sweet, smoky oak on this Chardonnay, with caramel and buttered toast flavors, but the underlying fruit is so massive, it easily handles that weight. Explodes in ripe pineapple and peach jam flavors, balanced with crisp acidity, like a squirt of lime. A really good wine for drinking now with serious fare.",93,39.0
3617,Kendall-Jackson,"A wonderfully good wine, especially at this price. Easily the best K-J Vintner's Reserve ever. Inky black, full-bodied and dry, it houses rich, complex blackberry, plum and smoky oak flavors, wrapped into finely ground, firm tannins. Run, don't walk, to find this affordable beauty.",92,18.0
3618,Concha y Toro,"This is a round, creamy, soft Chardonnay with resiny aromas. A strange, forced oak flavor dominates the flavor profile, which includes spice more than fruit. On the finish, oak and resin are about all you get.",83,12.0
3619,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"This comes from an underrated appellation, in the shadow of the Corton-Charlemagne vineyard. It's touched lightly by wood aging, showing ripe yellow fruit and a cool streak of minerality. Still young, it's developing well and will be ready to drink from 2018.",92,38.0
3620,Louis Latour,"Rich, round and concentrated, this is developing fast. The acidity is already comfortably embedded in the ripe red-berry fruit..",89,65.0
3621,Chanson Père et Fils,"Concentrated and complex, this has structure and acidity, with a black cherry flavor. It's a ripe, powerful wine that could become more generous as it ages.",89,72.0
3622,Chanson Père et Fils,"This shows the richness of the vintage in its ripe red fruits. It has weight as well as tannins, with a solid, firmly structured base of red plum fruit.",89,68.0
3623,Undurraga,"A little murky and muddled on the nose, this has an earthy-berry aroma, with a hint of floral-based perfume. It offers acidity and solidity on the palate, which is backed by standard black-fruit flavors, with undertones of vanilla and raw oak. Very good, but it's a bit oaky.",87,16.0
3624,Montes,"Heavy aromas of oak, char and syrupy berry fruits don't smell entirely natural. This feels tannic and scratchy, with missing parts. The flavor of candied, sweet, dominating oak is front and center, while mint, carob and stewed berry flavors finish this off.",84,16.0
3625,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,The wine is so soft that only the light wood flavors give it shape. It is smooth with red plum fruits that are rounded and sweet in style. Acidity seems to be an afterthought. Drink now.,84,16.0
3626,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"Soft and fruity, this is a rounded, simple wine. It has apple and light spice and a gentle texture that is already approachable. Juicy and fresh, not a wine for aging, it is ready to drink now.",84,17.0
3627,Testarossa,"Testarossa's track record with this wine has been on an upward spiral. The '06 shows the winery's usual deft hand at crafting delicately structured, elegant but powerfully flavored wines. Cherries, black raspberries, currants and blood oranges flood the mouth, ending in a swirl of clove and anise. Best now–2010.",93,54.0
3628,Testarossa,"A beautiful Pinot Noir, lilting, refined and utterly delicious. Testarossa stumbled with the '04, but otherwise their track record is great, and the '06 is right up there with the marvelous '05 and '03. The wine's cherry, licorice and smoky oak flavors are captured in a rewarding texture of silk and satin.",93,54.0
3629,Concha y Toro,"This comes across as the best Don Melchor that Concha y Toro has produced, and at $69 it should be. It's very ripe, with oak sitting atop pure cassis and plum aromas. The palate is sweet, juicy and packed with dynamite blackberry and black plum flavors. Dark, chocolaty and long on the finish, with ripe tannins. Drink now or hold for five years.",93,69.0
3630,Williams Selyem,"With a generous bite of acidity, this fine Chardonnay is extremely flavorful. Traditionally one of the winery's top Chards, it's explosive in pineapple, Asian pear, crème brûlée and roasted marshmallow flavors. Finishes in a swirl of creamy, buttery spices.",93,50.0
3631,Testarossa,"Despite the pale color, this is a powerful wine. It comes from this famous vineyard that pioneered the Santa Rita Hills. Erupts in the mouth with cherry, currant, licorice, cola and vanilla flavors that finish dry and spicy. The tannic edge suggests ageability, which Pinots from this vineyard are easily capable of. Best now–2012.",92,56.0
3632,Concha y Toro,"A little rubbery and tough on first sniff, but this pedigreed Chilean Cab settles with airing and soon shows exciting, fully ripe raspberry, cassis and blackberry flavors. The mouthfeel is perfectly cushioned yet intense, and the finish is ripe, smooth and composed. Ready to go now but should hold steady for another three years.",92,37.0
3633,Iron Horse,"Right up there with the wonderful '05, Iron Horse's '06 shows the brisk acids and long hangtime flavors the wine is known for. The cherry, currant, licorice, root beer and Provençal herb flavors are rich and savory, leading to a complex finish.",92,40.0
3634,Williams Selyem,"With residual sugar of 22.4%, this dessert wine has fantastically sweet flavors of apricot jam, tangerine marmalade, gingersnap cookie, vanilla and crème brûlée, balanced with crisp acidity. The alcohol is a refreshingly low 9.8%.",92,50.0
3635,Santa Ema,"Opens with generic red fruit and candy aromas, but the palate is overtly acidic, which causes a sourness to go with candied, medicinal berry fruit flavors. After the tartness subsides, there's regular red fruit notes left over.",83,12.0
3636,Testarossa,"Salted peach, vanilla-smeared French toast and a hint of guava make for a very powerful aromatic impression on this wine from the Arroyo Grande appellation at the southern end of San Luis Obispo County. Those scents don't exactly translate to the palate, though, where the wine it a bit leaner than promised, with apple pie flavors the most dominant.",90,45.0
3637,Louis Jadot,"Dense tannins dominate this firm and structured wine. Behind the dry surface lies fruitiness, bringing out red currant and berry flavors along  with acidity. The wine is potentially rich and deliciously perfumed. Drink from 2017.",90,36.0
3638,Albert Bichot,"The wine has aromas of pears. There is plenty of fruit here, but the freshness is missing, giving a southern, warm feel.",85,
3639,Concha y Toro,"For a huge-volume wine, it's what we'd expect. Controlled oak results in aromas of coffee, vanilla, marshmallow and resin in addition to cassis and cherry, while the palate offers generic fruit flavors as well as vanilla and herbal notes. A bit puckery and scratchy, but keep in mind that annual production tops 1.3 million cases.",85,10.0
3640,Chehalem,"Some might say this is old-school Oregon Pinot, with an emphasis on herbal acidic flavors and thin tart fruits. Despite aggressive aeration, the wine refuses to open up, and the impression of barely ripe fruit and chalky acids lingers.",86,80.0
3641,DFJ Vinhos,"Generous and ripe, this is a wine that is finely balanced and very ready to drink. Ripe tannins, soft texture and final acidity make for an easy-drinking wine.",86,9.0
3642,Testarossa,"Warm vanilla notes are laid across ripe nectarine, apple skin and a twist of lemon rind on this single-vineyard study by the Los Gatos-based winery. Pencil lead kicks off the palate, which then opens into poached apples and lemon oil, laid across a sizzling acidity that lasts long.",91,48.0
3643,Fess Parker,"Give this Chard a year in the cellar to let the oak integrate with everything else. Right now, it shows a woody sappiness that dominates. Under that is a fine wine, dry, acidic and ripe in pears, Meyer lemons, green apples and golden mangoes.",91,35.0
3644,Undurraga,"Spicy and peppery, with lots of body and richness. In a word, it's true Carmenère. The fruit here is ripe and lush, with plenty of herbal essence, and for every drop of plum or black cherry there's a balancing hint of green herb and bell pepper, which does not signal underripeness. The finish is tight and long, with some espresso flavor. If you're interested in trying a well-made Carmenère, give this a go.",87,11.0
3645,Montes,"Big and ripe, with cola, root beer and berry aromas along with rich oak. The palate is a high-wire act of bright red fruit combined with thick milk chocolate and malt. The tannins and acidity allow the wine to be aggressive, maybe too much so given that the fruit is somewhat tart and prickly.",86,20.0
3646,Montes,"Simple and clean up front, with inviting aromas. The mouth on this wine is broad and satisfying, and the flavors of plum, blackberry, black olive and buttery oak work in tandem. The finish is a bit aggressive, and here the oak is powerful as it leaves a bitter lasting sensation. But overall the wine impresses for its solidity and full fruit.",86,10.0
3647,Concha y Toro,"Everything about this mass-market Chard works. The nose has some pleasant nectarine and apricot aromas, while the mouth is racy and lively, and loaded with mango, pear and honeydew flavors. The finish is fruity, if a tad sweet. Nevertheless it's fresh and clean, and it leaves a good lasting impression. Anyone who likes a sweeter-styled white will fancy this. Best Buy.",86,7.0
3648,Testarossa,"Lots of flavor packed into this light-bodied, smoothly textured wine, although it's a bit one-dimensional. Flavors veer toward raspberry cola and lots of dusty, peppery spices, wrapped in silky tannins and boosted by crisp acids.",86,50.0
3649,Concha y Toro,"Quiet on the bouquet except for a dusting of oak and banana. The palate is heavy and wide, if a bit flabby, and the flavors of melon and mango run sweet, much like fruit punch. Soft and sweet on the finish as well, and overall it's good but generic. Not many Chards in the price range will fare better.",85,8.0
3650,Chehalem,"At 6% residual sugar and just 7% alcohol, you might expect this to be dessert-like. But the delicate spritz and grapefruit-like acidity keeps it in the apéritif range, with Moscato-like orange-candy flavors and a juicy, fruity mouthfeel.",87,24.0
3651,Chehalem,"Tart and tightly focused, this single-block expression is pure green-apple fruit and acid.",87,28.0
3652,Concha y Toro,"This is waxy smelling, with a coastal vegetal note that conveys cool-climate grapes. The palate is short and clipped in feel, with a waxy, mealy note to the wine's core melon and peach flavors. It's chunky on the finish and is a touch mealy in taste.",87,17.0
3653,Testarossa,"Ripe, jammy orange, lime, apricot and mango fruit flavors join with buttered toast and vanilla flavors to make for an opulent, yet simple, Chardonnay. Brisk acidity provides balance.",85,30.0
3654,Iron Horse,"Mainly Pinot Noir, with just 15% Chardonnay, this full-bodied bubbly has notes of seemingly sweet raspberries. The mouthfeel is slightly coarse. Still, it shows plenty of elegance, and if you're toasting the wedding couple, it's just fine.",87,38.0
3655,Louis Latour,"Very soft and dull, it offers white fruits and some acidity. Drink now.",83,24.0
3656,Chehalem,"Flavors roll from cranberry to sweet red cherry in a red-fruit riot. It was aged in 52% new and 24% one-year-old oak, but it's unobtrusive and not especially toasty. The barrel time has begun to smooth out any bumps and rough edges, though a touch of phenolic bite remains. Drink from 2018 to 2022.",90,70.0
3657,Kunde,"The vineyard needs a warm vintage to fully ripen, which 2010 definitely wasn't. The wine is acidic and green, with an ammonia edge to the pineapples, mangoes and limes.",85,15.0
3658,Testarossa,"Stark minerality, from hot gravel to chipped slate, meets with garrigue elements of lavender and thyme on the nose of this strong bottling that gains a savory quality thanks to roasted-pork aromas. The requisite fruit arrives on the sip, where smashed cranberry meets with pepper spice and dried herbs. The structure is grippy and affords great length in the finish.",94,64.0
3659,Foxen,"Fresh cranberry and black raspberry show on the nose of this bottling that also offers black-pepper sauce, savory soy and a touch of iodine. There's a tarry tension to the palate, but with tart dark cranberry and richer dark cherry flavors as well, mixing up the savory smoke with dense fruit.",94,65.0
3660,Robert Mondavi,"Dry, smooth and distinguished. Shows Mondavi's ability to get the grapes ripe in blackberries and currants, yet the fruit pulls back at the last moment, letting earthy, herbal notes take over, providing complexity and endless pleasure. The tannins are pure Oakville—sweet, soft and supple. Drink this elegant, balanced wine over the next six years.",94,45.0
3661,Feudi di San Gregorio,"This vineyard-designate Taurasi Riserva is probably one of the biggest, boldest wines produced in Italy. It opens with an inky black color and intense aromas of black fruit, toast, spice, espresso bean and bitter black chocolate. The jackhammer tannins are steady and firm, and there's a long tail of prune and black fruit on the finish.",94,65.0
3662,Kendall-Jackson,"Delicious fruit aromas and abundant spices waft up from the glass. The flavors follow suit, with ripe plum, strawberry and cinnamon all well supported by firm acidity and a medium-to-full body. This is a well-rounded wine that's easy to enjoy.",91,30.0
3663,Concha y Toro,"Oaky aromas of bacon and ham blend with vanilla on the nose of this plump, melony wine. Flavors of resiny oak, Animal Cracker cookies and melon turn overtly spicy on the finish that includes a hint of clove.",89,22.0
3664,Siduri,"Elegant aromas of black plum, asphalt, black tea and sandalwood show on the nose of this appellation blend from Adam Lee. The palate offers hints of forest floor with mushroom and mulberry flavors, as well as a persistent woody spice.",89,39.0
3665,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,Old vines on the Aegerter Domaine in Savigny-lès-Beaune give a rounded ripe wine. It has a crisper red-cherry side to its otherwise smooth texture. The tannins support all this juicy fruit and offer a chance for the wine to age. Drink from 2020.,89,47.0
3666,Columbia Crest,"Merlot (80%) is in the lead on this blend, with the rest rounded out by Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Malbec. Cocoa, dark raspberry, vanilla and toast aromas lead to supple fruit and barrel flavors backed by grainy tannins that need some time in the cellar to smooth out.",91,35.0
3667,Gary Farrell,"This is another of the producer's intellectual exercises in experimental winemaking, made in tiny case-production numbers. It offers so much to think about, from its lemony-crisp and tangy palate to its chalky tannins. Full bodied, it merits attention, veering from herbal to chocolaty in one sip.",91,75.0
3668,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Honeysuckle, mineral, honey and botrytis aromas lead the way. This drinks off dry with exceptionally well-balanced acidity that carries through the lingering finish.",90,16.0
3669,Columbia Crest,"Cocoa, plum and vanilla aromas are followed by creamy-feeling blue-fruit flavors that display a mixture of fruit and barrel. The barrel influence is heavy, but it's delicious all the same.",90,12.0
3670,Columbia Crest,"This wine was aged 15 months sur lee in all-new French oak. The barrel aromas and flavors are in the lead, with notes of vanilla, butterscotch and spice followed by pear. It's creamy in feel but with an elegant styling.",90,26.0
3671,Undurraga,"This opens hard and crusty, but with airing it softens as chocolate, plastic, creamy oak and spice aromas emerge. The palate is compact and fairly full bodied, with herbal, roasted, leathery tasting berry flavors that end with savory, oaky notes. Overall, this is a good blend of Cabernet and Carmenère.",87,13.0
3672,Concha y Toro,"Herb and olive aromas give this Malbec a slightly green nose. There's a lot of body and acid once it hits the palate along with flavors of herbal berry, mint and pepper. This is sturdy, fully oaked and minty on the finish.",87,17.0
3673,Concha y Toro,"This first-time Riesling from CyT delivers petrol/diesel aromas along with mild apple and peach scents on what amounts to a true, varietal nose. The palate has a punch-like, juicy feel that's fresh but light, while tropical flavors of lychee and mango end juicy but with weight.",87,
3674,Siduri,"Crisp earth and seamless tannin give this wine a sultry softness around a subtle overlay of oak. Black cherry and leather meet in the middle, buoyed by a zest of acidity, medium weight and a lengthy finish.",88,33.0
3675,Chehalem,"This blend of the three estate vineyards is the first Pinot to be released from each vintage. Here it spent time in 22% oak, roughly half new. Cranberry, pomengranate, dried herbs and some gently earthy tannins combine in a tart, gulpable style.",88,32.0
3676,Gary Farrell,"The Ramal Vineyard has been source to a fine series of Buena Vista Pinot Noirs. Farrell has captured another interpretation of its terroir, not quite as lush or ripe, but firm in acid-inspired cherries and licorice, with a subtle veneer of smoky oak. It's a dry, crisp young wine, well-structured, a good partner for upscale fare such as lamb chops.",90,50.0
3677,Santa Ema,"Plum and raspberry aromas are herbal and slightly grassy. On the tongue, wiry acidity feels citric. Flavors of red plum, spiced cherry, tomato and herbs ride a road of choppy acidity and rough tannins to a bold finish. Drink through 2020.",88,24.0
3678,Santa Ema,"This dark, muscular Carignan smells cool and earthy, with a heavy dose of unintegrated oak creating woodgrain and vanilla aromas. This feels full but shows structural gaps, while blackberry, clove and resiny, grainy flavors finish with tannic hardness and lasting woody flavors.",88,30.0
3679,Gary Farrell,"A shy nose demands further time in the glass to open this medium-bodied and truly compelling offering from this far-flung coastal site. A depth of black cherry, cranberry and black tea awaits, marked by tart acidity and silky-smooth waves of flavor and body.",94,70.0
3680,Wines & Winemakers,"A crisp, caramel- and red-fruit-flavored blend of Castelão, Touriga Nacional and Syrah, this is ready to drink. Produced at Casa Ermelinda Freitas winery, it has a salty edge from the nearby ocean, finishing with plenty of acidity.",86,12.0
3681,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Aromas of pear, Spanish broom, flint and Mediterranean herb emerge in the glass. The juicy, medium-bodied palate offers ripe apple, peach and lime alongside fresh acidity and a mineral vein. A hazelnut note marks the close.",90,21.0
3682,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Heady aromas of citrus and orchard fruit almost jump out of the glass. The savory, medium-bodied palate tastes of ripe pear, mature apple and creamy peach interspersed with energizing mineral notes. Fresh acidity brightens the creamy flavors.",90,21.0
3683,Columbia Crest,"Big, bold, and buttery, with plenty of oaky micro-popcorn flavors. Don't look for subtlety, but you get plenty of flavor.",86,11.0
3684,Trapiche,"Big and boisterous, as if you're sniffing a bed of coal, menthol and macerated black fruit. The palate is sun-drenched and juicy, but not what you'd call elevated. And the finish mixes savory flavors with tight tannins. A good red wine that bears little semblance to Old World Syrah.",86,11.0
3685,Williams Selyem,"A new bottling from the winery. The vineyard is in the Petaluma Gap, a cool area south of the Russian River Valley, toward San Francisco. The vintage was cool, too, so the wine is brisk in acidity and low in alcohol, but it still tastes amazingly ripe and complex. The wine dazzles with waves of black raspberry jam, sweet olive tapenade, sautéed brown mushroom, root beer, moo-shu plum sauce and mocha. If those flavors sound like they don't go together, just try the wine. It's seamless and compelling. Drink now–2020.",96,55.0
3686,Siduri,"Made in the fruit-forward, balanced and delicious style that is Siduri's, this is their basic Santa Lucia regional blend. It's quite a good wine, rich in currant, cherry, root beer, chocolate, mint and pepper flavors. Best now and for a few years.",90,33.0
3687,Siduri,"Here's a big, thick, rich, jammy young Pinot Noir. With its eruption of berry, cherry, milk chocolate and anise spice flavors and dramatic tannic structure, it's not particularly subtle, but will excite fans of extracted Santa Lucia Highlands Pinot Noirs. Will probably age for many years.",90,49.0
3688,Kunde,"Kunde's been on a consistent roll for years in crafting rich, balanced Viogniers. Their 2007 is crisp and ripe, offering a blast of tropical fruit, honeysuckle, vanilla and spice flavors that finish impressively long. Nice with fusion fare, or for something different, Tex-Mex.",90,24.0
3689,Fess Parker,"This wine's light and refreshing nose cuts between orange-blossom ripeness, lime-juice sharpness, chalky minerality and a touch of milk fat. There is good energy on the palate, powered by tart green apple rinds and citrus zest.",88,19.0
3690,Wines & Winemakers,"With minty wood flavors, this wine is smooth and polished. It offers berry fruits from the blend of 10 varieties in this old-vine vineyard. With spice and some firm tannins in the background, it is ready to drink.",90,18.0
3691,Wines & Winemakers,"Pure Alvarinho from the north of the Vinho Verde region makes this a smooth, ripe wine. It is perfumed, stylish and with a good balance between acidity and refreshing green and white fruitiness. Drink the wine now.",90,20.0
3692,Williams Selyem,"Marked by immediately likeable fruit in the form of raspberries and cherries, this pleasant Pinot has a rich coating of sweet, smoky oak. It's the most accessible of Williams Selyem's new releases.",88,49.0
3693,Williams Selyem,"A big, boldly powerful but elegant Zinfandel, full-bodied in the mouth and dry, offering waves of ripe fruits and spices. The cool 2007 vintage has kept the wine from being too ripe, resulting in balanced flavors of blackberries, currants, licorice, bacon, cocoa, black pepper and Asian spices. Just terrific. Drink over the next six years.",93,48.0
3694,Williams Selyem,"This is one of the darkest of Williams Selyem's new Pinots and also one of the ripest. It's jammy in the intensity of raspberry and cherry fruit, with a savory, Dr. Pepper cola richness. The spiciness, which is one of winemaker Bob Cabral's specialties in capturing, is exotic. It's a big, fat, rich wine that needs decanting now, and should age for 4–6 years.",93,69.0
3695,Chehalem,"A spot-on Oregon Grüner, this is dry and spicy. It's clean as a whistle, with flavors of celery, lemon and sour peach.",88,24.0
3696,Georges Duboeuf,"Soft, smooth and buttery, this is full of ripe tropical fruits and bright, citrusy acidity. Ready to drink.",86,19.0
3697,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"This lightly aromatic wine offers notes of butterscotch, peach and toasty spices. It's lighter in style with a creamy feel to the stone and tropical fruit flavors.",88,17.0
3698,Columbia Crest,"Aromatically pleasing, this suggests fresh blueberry pie, with a whiff of smoked meat. It's straightforward with huckleberry and mocha flavors, trailing slightly toward the finish.",88,12.0
3699,V. Sattui,"There's lots of sweetness in this polished wine, with pretty orange, peach, vanilla and honeysuckle flavors. It would benefit from greater acidity, though, as it's a bit soft.",86,25.0
3700,Foxen,"There's a forest-floor touch to the nose of this appellation blend that also shows smoked and raw beef, hearty berries and a slight compost touch. The mouthfeel is soft, with flavors of iron and aged beef giving nuance to the tart raspberry, pomegranate, chipped slate and dried-mint finish.",91,35.0
3701,Gary Farrell,"Intensely dense and feral, this wine opens with a thicket of tart cherry and strawberry, followed by leathery black pepper and lavender. Medium in body and acidity, it works for the table, finding balance as it goes, before a rich taste of toffee finishes things off.",92,50.0
3702,Wines & Winemakers,"Caramel and strawberry aromas lead to a ripe, while still, crisp crushed red berry wine. Good acidity, a light just off-dry texture.",83,11.0
3703,DFJ Vinhos,"Described as medium sweet, this is soft and sugary, its tannins at an awkward angle to the soft surroundings. This style works better with the rosé and white versions of Portada.",82,9.0
3704,Columbia Crest,"Tart, leafy, with light strawberry fruit. This has little depth, just a pleasant strawberry nose and a simple, fruity palate.",84,35.0
3705,Concha y Toro,"Piercing aromas of red-berry fruits and red-apple skins are a touch rough but improve with airing. This feels fresh, medium in size, and tastes of herbal plum and cherry prior to a lightly herbal finish.",87,16.0
3706,Concha y Toro,"Although this opens with aromatic notes of inner tube and iodine, airing reveals dry herb scents and medicinal cherry and berry aromas. With proper weight and balance, this basic Malbec tastes of cherry cough drop and plum, with a dash of green herbs.",87,11.0
3707,Wines & Winemakers,"Almost black in color, this is a powerful and concentrated wine. Named after the barn owl that is found in the woods around the vines, it is packed with dense and dry tannins. Acidity comes from the black currant fruit while perfumes come from the Touriga Nacional in the blend. Drink this complex wine from 2017.",93,23.0
3708,Chehalem,"The best of the three vineyard designates in 2010, this firm and full-flavored wine is still a bit tight, and rewards extra breathing time. It tastes like a bowl full of berries and plums with pretty mocha highlights.",90,48.0
3709,Chehalem,"Using grapes from all three estate vineyards, this slightly sweet (2.5% residual sugar) Riesling is textural and complex. Flavors of fruit skin and rind dominate, notably grapefruit and peach pit.",89,24.0
3710,Concha y Toro,"This has a dense bouquet, with aromas of beet, clove, mint, tomato and berry fruit. The mouthfeel is rich and saturated, with a rawness that didn't exist in prior years. Flavors of mixed herb, earth and savory berry end with a long finish.",89,38.0
3711,Fess Parker,"This brilliant wine is dry and tart in acidity, minerally, and supremely refined in Meyer lemons, pears, limes and tart apples. It's not one of those fat Chardonnays that melts in the mouth, but instead has firm texture and elegant complexity. It makes a beautiful accompaniment to grilled salmon, crab cakes, or a simple but glorious roasted chicken. Don't drink it too cold.",94,36.0
3712,Concha y Toro,"Sort of heavy, with touches of baked corn and hay. But it also has nice baked apple flavors and pretty good oak. On the finish, there's vanilla, almond, citrus and apple, and then very late comes hazelnut and even more vanilla. Drink now; it's not going to last much longer.",88,35.0
3713,Undurraga,"Fiery on first blush, this then displays aromas of plum, leather, tobacco and cheesy oak. It feels fresh and not the least bit fat or flabby, with cassis, raspberry, olive, cocoa and mint flavors. The finish is composed, dry and lightly herbal. A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Carmenère, Syrah and Carignan.",90,60.0
3714,Siduri,"Tart and tutti-fruity-sweet in raspberries, cherries and cola, and spiced with cinnamon, clove, nutmeg and white pepper that give it a savory edge. Gets credit for sheer ripeness, yet missing a certain depth and complexity. Drink now–2014.",89,50.0
3715,Wines & Winemakers,"Although this rosé smells of wild strawberries, the aroma is better than the palate, which tastes chemical with a bitter almond aftertaste. Serve very cold.",82,
3716,Williams Selyem,"This small-production Chardonnay (only 272 cases) is exceptionally rich and ripe, as Williams Selyem Chardonnays consistently are. Intense flavors of tropical fruit and pear pie (with a smoky, buttery crust) make for a powerful palate. The acidity is mouthwatering. This is the ideal wine for cracked crab and a sourdough baguette with butter.",94,65.0
3717,Bründlmayer,This is a powerful wine that's very richly textured and with a structure that promises aging. It has weight and superripe peach and apricot flavors. There is a fine cut of acidity to give both freshness and aging potential. Drink from 2016.,94,
3718,Williams Selyem,"This is a medium-bodied Zinfandel, with elegant weight and mouthfeel. The flavors are classic—wild raspberries and cherries, cola, cocoa and exotic spices. This is surely one of the best Zinfandels of the vintage.",94,52.0
3719,Bründlmayer,"A savory note of yeast swings along the green pear and grapefruit peel notes on this totally brisk and refreshing Grüner. Yes, the customary texture and spice are there but this is, as a sign of its vintage, totally streamlined and refreshing, with taut acidity reverberating in every corner. For those who like superfresh wines.",92,32.0
3720,Testarossa,"A stellar wine, this appellation blend rivals some of the Los Gatos-based winery's single vineyard expressions. Exotic dried apples, vanilla cream and popcorn pop on the nose, while there palate's extreme acidity and explosiveness freshness demands immediate enjoyment. Butter-seared apples, grapefruit pith and a touch of flint round out the flavors.",92,38.0
3721,Testarossa,"Very broad but also complete and elegant aromas show on this bottling, including Asian pear, yellow apple, Meyer lemon, wet stone and a touch of browned butter. The mouthfeel is very tense though not overly sharp in acidity, with lemon and key lime citrus. That tension holds deep into the sip.",92,49.0
3722,Williams Selyem,"A very good, impressively concentrated Pinot Noir, with flashy, ripe cherry, blackberry and currant flavors. It's a little too robust right now, with an almost rustic mouthfeel, but could develop bottle complexity over the years.",89,56.0
3723,Chehalem,"Oddly, among a nice selection of Chehalem Rieslings, this seems disjointed, with sour flavors and other components that don't quite knit together. Finished with a screwcap closure, there's no bad cork to point the finger at. Maybe more bottle age will help to pull it together.",85,29.0
3724,Iron Horse,"You won't miss the presence of oak in this Chardonnay. It's brilliantly forward, ripe and savory, with orange, mango and lime flavors. Natural acidity and a creamy, leesy richness bring extra layers of appeal, and the finish is thoroughly dry.",92,27.0
3725,Williams Selyem,"This is a terrific Zinfandel, offering berry, cherry, mocha, spice and cedar flavors that come wrapped in briary tannins. It's technically dry, but with a satisfying honeyed note.",92,50.0
3726,Iron Horse,"This is a clean, elegant and complex wine, brisk in acidity and dry in citrus and tropical fruit flavors.",92,48.0
3727,Santa Ema,"Black-fruit aromas of cassis and boysenberry are not overdone nor overoaked. Thie palate feels somewhat spiky and acidic, with a tartaric bite. A flavor profile comprised of salty berry fruits finishes briny and herbal, with good weight and balance.",87,15.0
3728,Siduri,"Kudos to Siduri for offering a serious Oregon Pinot Noir at alcohol levels (13%) reminiscent of Burgundy. It's a welcome tilt for the state that once was tagged as the new world's Burgundian hope, but which has sometimes seemed more like a California wannabe. Light and tart, this isn't a complex wine but brings the delicate nuances of the grape, with cranberry, citrus and strawberry.",88,39.0
3729,Siduri,"This bottling brings strawberry preserves right up front; it's a light and spicy wine with immediate appeal. There's plenty of acid—rarely an issue in Oregon—but not much depth. It's got fruit and malted chocolate, and the finish lasts a bit longer than you might expect from the light fruit.",88,39.0
3730,Testarossa,"This begins with a reserved nose that unfolds into deep, black aromas of licorice, turned earth and graphite. Pomegranate and acai fruit flavors mix with red clay and touches of whiskey, but the tannins are powerful. Give it until at least 2018 to smooth out.",88,61.0
3731,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"This firm wine still needs to shed its youthful structure of tannin and bring out the underlying ripe fruits. It has weight, hints of juicy acidity and a medium-term potential. The end shows some of the natural concentration from old vines.",88,52.0
3732,Gary Farrell,"If you like yours big and burly, then this might be the right wine for you. Applesauce and lemon meringue pie aromas lead the way toward a palate full of lemon, pineapple, tangerine and vanilla. The finish is stony and leaves a custard-like impression. It's clearly from the barrel-fermented school, but for some that may be fine. For others, however, it will feel overoaked and ponderous on the tongue.",87,20.0
3733,Iron Horse,"This 14.5% bruiser contains 20% Viognier, which adds a tropical fruit character to the nose and palate. The mouthfeel is soft, with flavors heavy on banana and melon. Woody characteristics such as nuttiness, particularly almonds, also pop up. To its detriment, the oak and fruit seem to be fighting each other more than complementing one another.",87,19.0
3734,Louis Latour,"It's plump and juicy, yet not devoid of structure, blending Asian pear and citrus aromas and flavors with nectarine skin and bitter almond. There's a softness to the finish that causes it to lose a little definition but helps it go down easy.",87,34.0
3735,Louis Latour,"A firm, powerful wine, its tannins still very dominant. Acidity is a factor, along with deep red-plum fruit. Some sweetness will develop in the next several years, although this concentrated and complex wine will also have a solid core of dry, structured tannin. Age for at least five years.",93,130.0
3736,Chanson Père et Fils,"This is dark and wood laden, with sweet, rich fruit and a firm, dense structure. It has a full feel, and its opulence is likely to develop over the next 2–3 years.",93,107.0
3737,Chanson Père et Fils,"This is crisp, with citrus and red apple fruits that are heightened by the taut structure. Nervy acidity adds to the tense feel while judicious layers of wood warm the finish. For long-term aging.",93,94.0
3738,Chanson Père et Fils,"A wine with just the right Meursault opulence already the dominant character. The wine is fat, ripe, not losing sight of acidity or freshness, combining yellow fruits with a crisp, citrus final streak.",87,60.0
3739,Louis Latour,"This is soft, full of ripe white fruit flavors. The wine is broad, showing some freshness along with the forward richness. It is likely to age relatively quickly.",87,49.0
3740,Chehalem,"The Stoller-sourced Pinot is forward and ripe, with pretty fruit flavors in a compact, light vintage. Cola, peach, black cherry and milk chocolate components swirl together, fading gently into a light finish. Drink over the next 2–3 years.",88,50.0
3741,Columbia Crest,"This is pure Viognier, finishing in a moderately sweet, dessert-friendly style. There is a candied sensation to the mouthfeel, and the fruit seems rather thin. Light flavors of orange pekoe carry into a gentle finish.",86,24.0
3742,Trapiche,"Piercing aromas of char and creosote are like a laser pop surrounded by a note of blackberry. This is raw, tannic and hard on the palate. Chunky berry flavors are heavily oaked, while this is jammy in feel and tastes of blueberry on the finish. Drink through 2021.",90,55.0
3743,Kunde,"From the mountains above the winery, this blends 39% Cabernet Sauvignon, 34% Cabernet Franc, 24% Petit Verdot and 3% Malbec. The result is a harmonious palate of dried herb, cedar and pungent violet flavors. Full-bodied concentration makes it rugged, accented with toasted oak.",90,100.0
3744,Santa Ema,"Other than notes of white flowers and green herbs on the nose, this wine is all about canned peas and beans. The palate has texture and flesh, but the flavors are vegetal.",81,9.0
3745,V. Sattui,"A little rough around the edges, but otherwise a soft, juicy wine for drinking now. It has pleasant cherry pie and ripe red-currant fruit flavors. Air it in a decanter or in the glass for an hour before drinking.",86,29.0
3746,DFJ Vinhos,"Fragrant and fruity, this is a bright, crisp and clean wine that's totally ready to drink. Lively, with a cool feeling like the nearby ocean's breezes, it finishes with light acidity.",86,6.0
3747,Williams Selyem,"Seductively smooth and intriguingly aromatic, this blend of several knock-out vineyards along Westside Road—Allen, Bacigalupi, Bucher, Rochioli Riverblock and Williams Selyem Estate—is instantly delicious, sharing a concentration of cherry, strawberry and citrus that perfectly captures the essence of the fruit, accented by a tease of black tea. An earthy minerality wraps around dry, polished tannins, with a streak of just-right acidity, giving it a realm of juiciness and flavorful sophistication. Enjoy through 2023.",98,69.0
3748,Williams Selyem,"Silky, with pronounced tannins that should mellow in time, this is an earthy, stemmy and perfumed wine. Succulent and balanced, it's brightly exuberant in black cherry yet brooding and complex throughout, changing slightly from savory to floral and back again. It's an incredible wine out of the gate; cellar with confidence, through 2021.",96,75.0
3749,Williams Selyem,"This wine, a regional blend, shows remarkable achievement in winemaking. Wild strawberry and red cherry exude on the entry, alongside floral elements of violet and lilac. Velvety, resolved tannins make it enjoyable from the get-go, layered in acidity for a buoyant lift on the midpalate and finish, which suggests cinnamon and tea. Enjoy now and through 2020.",95,52.0
3750,Williams Selyem,"Just beautiful, this wine combines spicy, arresting aromas, vivid, bright cherry and raspberry flavors, an electric mouthfeel and bracing texture. All nerve and muscle, and no fat, it is vibrant in acidity, with firm tannins that support the enticing fruit flavors. Virtually irresistible now, this will gain complexity through at least 2022.",96,65.0
3751,Bründlmayer,"Beautifully lifted, almost sublimated apple and citrus fruit combine to make a perfumed, appetizing nose. That pure apple theme continues on the concentrated palate that sings with purity to leave a satisfying and honest impression of completeness. Pure and simply very delicious.",96,35.0
3752,Williams Selyem,"A perennial standout for good reason, this Pinot is light in color and elusive at first. Teasing in baked strawberry-rhubarb, it subtly offers a rare purity of focused fruit flavor, with gorgeous aromas of dewy rose petals playing a substantial supporting role. Thanks to subtle oak, the finish builds in terms of intensity, with the wine maintaining a delicate balance of minerality.",96,82.0
3753,Williams Selyem,"Since this is the winery's largest production Pinot, but still under 1,000 cases, buyers actually have a chance of finding this full-bodied beauty. Sly on the nose, it is tense in toasty oak and chewy cherry, venturing into black cherry, blackberry and root beer. It's amply structured and robust, yet with silky tannins. Enjoy through 2022.",95,52.0
3754,Albert Bichot,"This 2011 is an aristocratic wine, with a mineral character that is now rounding out. Yellow and green fruits mingle with some tannins and a steely core. It will age for several years more, so drink from 2018.",95,
3755,Louis Latour,"This is a beautiful wine, full of ripe yellow fruits, steely acidity and a juicy character that comes from the apple and apricot fruit flavors. While there is a firm layer of toast from the wood aging, the wine is rich, tight and full of acidity. This structured wine needs many years, so drink from 2020.",95,
3756,Albert Bichot,"While not in the official canon of Grand Crus, La Moutonne is definitely in grand cru territory, a parcel that is divided between Les Preuses and Vaudésir. The 2012 is very structured, dense and textured, with a strongly tannic character packed with minerality. Time will bring out its fruit and richness. Drink from 2019.",95,
3757,Siduri,"The pedigree of this vineyard shows in every aspect. It's not just the ripe black cherry and pomegranate fruit, or the brisk acidity, or the lush, gorgeous tannin structure. It's the incredible complexity, showing all kinds of mushroom,  cola, smoked meat and spice notes. Simply gorgeous now, and should develop over the next 10 years.",94,52.0
3758,V. Sattui,"V. Sattui has quietly been producing outstanding Cabernets, and here's another. The vineyard is on the Rutherford bench, arguably the tenderloin of the appellation. Made from 100% Cabernet, the wine is sumptuously rich and soft in tannins, with sour red-cherry candy, licorice, bacon and pepper spice flavors. Will age well for at least 10 years.",94,55.0
3759,Wines & Winemakers,"Full and round, this is a ripe blackberry-flavored wine. It has a touch of licorice, followed by juicy fruitiness and some acidity. The aftertaste, with its flavors of wood aging, suggests it could mature through 2015.",85,12.0
3760,Wines & Winemakers,"This is a fine, simple wine for this summer. With acidity, fresh apple and pear flavors, it's attractive and aromatic.",85,11.0
3761,Chehalem,"Just a touch of residual sugar (11 g/L) softens up the edges of this wine, which brings flavors of tart lemon, grapefruit pith and wet paper into play. Try it with prawns, shellfish or non-spicy noodle dishes.",88,29.0
3762,Chehalem,"Done entirely in stainless tanks, this fruity wine offers spring fresh flavors of citrus, pineapple and green melon. With barely perceptible residual sugar, the acids keep it lip-smacking and lively. There is just a hint of buttery caramel at the core.",88,19.0
3763,Columbia Crest,"This very limited reserve is from a particular block, and as with most block selections, it offers focused, somewhat constrained flavors. Precisely defined red berry fruit is set in a frame of vanilla, toast and coffee. It's a pleasant, albeit generic quaffer.",88,30.0
3764,Montes,"Impressive as always, with dense, meaty aromas of baked black fruits, compost and dried cheese. The palate is thick to the max, with chocolate, coconut and baked plum and berry flavors. Ultrarich on the finish, with warmth and density. Once again ""M"" shows how deep and rewarding high-end Chilean reds can be. Drink now through 2015.",91,95.0
3765,Santa Ema,"From the outset this is woody and artificial in style. Aromas of milk chocolate and clove are strange and forced. In the mouth, this feels wiry but also gummy, with clove-heavy oak and tannic bite. In general, this is overly woody, candied and seemingly not natural.",82,14.0
3766,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Fresh and juicy, this opens with alluring aromas of ripe plum, violet, sunbaked soil and dark spice. The bright, silky palate offers crushed blackberry, succulent cherry, clove and star anise alongside supple tannins. Enjoy through 2018.",89,19.0
3767,Columbia Crest,"Aromas of coffee, gravel and boysenberry are followed by pillowy-soft fruit and barrel flavors. It displays delicacy and nuance.",89,35.0
3768,Siduri,"This crisp and lengthy vineyard-designate shows a depth of earth and rose petals against baked plum, orange zest and rhubarb. Mouthfilling acidity provides a freshness on the palate that persists through a long, spicy finish.",93,55.0
3769,Iron Horse,"This is an elusive, spicy wine made in larger amounts than many of the producer's other single-site wines and it shows a deftness of balance and blending. Tangy orange and cranberry wrap around a high acidity that plays out like wet stones and black tea with plenty of herbal backbone on display.",92,50.0
3770,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"This wine shows light aromas of blue fruit, plum and spice. The palate boasts sculpted fruit and barrel flavors, conveying a good sense of structure and balance.",89,24.0
3771,Chehalem,"All estate-grown grapes go into this early release. Juicy cranberry and raspberry fruit, tart and slightly savory, backs into drying tannins, finishing with a touch of stem.",89,29.0
3772,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"This wine has a bitter edge to it, although attractive fruit lies underneath. It is juicy, packed with red fruits and acidity, although that surface bitterness is off-putting.",84,23.0
3773,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"The Hautes Côtes need a good vintage to shine. The 2013 was not one of those vintages and this lean wine shows its structure more than its fruit. It gives a dry, tannic character that is unlikely to soften greatly. It could be worth waiting and drinking from 2017.",84,28.0
3774,Williams Selyem,"Tasted in early spring, this Chard was still tingly with acidity, but by the time you read this, everything should have calmed down. It's terrifically ripe with green apple, nectarine and tropical fruit flavors that are so rich, you won't even miss the oak.",90,37.0
3775,Lynmar,"Great price for a blush wine this sophisticated. Lynmar manages to tame Syrah's power and exuberance into elegant sleekness, resulting in a dry, tart wine with vibrant raspberry, orange zest and vanilla richness.",90,20.0
3776,Williams Selyem,"The winery sources this fruit from a vineyard near Hollister. It delivers aromas of bramble berry, espresso-dipped cherry and allspice. Cherry and chocolate power the palate, which also benefits from lifting mint, sagebrush and eucalyptus, finishing with chopped herbs.",93,58.0
3777,Kunde,"Split pea and earthy mushroom give way to sparkling acidity and a bright, flush taste of lemon and grapefruit in this succulent white, low in oak imprint. This is a food-friendly wine that can stand on its own, complex and layered with a citrus-squeezed finish.",90,25.0
3778,Casa Santos Lima,"A structured blend of a selection of Touriga Nacional and Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine is perfumed, ripe and firm. It has a dark core and rich, exuberant black fruits. With a few more months aging, this will develop further into a generous, smooth wine. Drink from late 2018.",90,25.0
3779,DFJ Vinhos,"This wine is structured and dense, benefiting from two years in oak to offer a balanced, round palate that's rich in spice and black fruit tones. Drink now.",90,30.0
3780,Louis Jadot,"Strongly wood-aged, this is a ripe, toasty wine. The citrus and creamed apple fruits are still working their way through the wood flavors. It's going to be richly fruity wine with a round texture that is cut by acidity. Give it time and drink from 2018.",90,54.0
3781,Siduri,"Ample acidity in this Pinot Noir makes you think of rich fare, like lamb, for the tartness to be balanced by meat fat. The wine is absolutely dry, while low alcohol lends it a light, silky mouthfeel. It's not an ager, but for the price, one of the most elegant Pinots on the market.",89,22.0
3782,Undurraga,"This heavy bubbly has aromas of matchstick, burnt grass and apple. It feels jagged and foamy, with mealy apple and hay flavors. The finish is fresh and lively, but it turns bitter as it fades.",84,40.0
3783,Kendall-Jackson,"There's a seemingly sweet edge to the lemon, lime and vanilla flavors, which are fortunately balanced with crisp acidity. Fans of richly styled white wines will like this bottling.",84,13.0
3784,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"Situated in Turckheim just below the Brand Grand Cru vineyard, Heimbourg is a great vineyard for Gewurztraminer. This wine is dense, rich, poised and balanced. The intense fruitiness is balanced by the structure and a crisp edge to its sweetness. Drink from 2017.",92,60.0
3785,Testarossa,"From one of the four Pinot Noir vineyards that this producer controls as monopoles, this dark-hued bottling shows blackberry, black plum, clove and star anise aromas. Tart cranberry, sour cherry and strawberry fruit marks the palate, rounded with rose petal and sage elements.",90,65.0
3786,Trapiche,"Earthy and leafy aromas yield to tomato leaf and weighty plum aromas. The palate is full but sharp, with tart, driving pie cherry and herbal flavors. Stays rather hard on the finish, where more tomato rolls out.",83,15.0
3787,DFJ Vinhos,"This is a simple fruity wine. It has attractive red-berry fruits, giving it a light and bright character. The wine is rounded and smooth, with an attractive lift of acidity at the end.",84,9.0
3788,Robert Mondavi,"Quite fruity and straightforward, with pleasant peach, melon and citrus flavors. The finish is clean and fresh and the wine well balanced.",84,9.0
3789,V. Sattui,"From old Lodi vines, V. Sattui's annual heartland Zin is minty and herbal, high-toned and tannic, able to find a nice equilibrium between opposing personalities. Leathery and akin to pipe tobacco, it offers a more savory side of Zin, and is worthy of cellaring until 2019 or so.",90,34.0
3790,Santa Ema,"Saline, lime, grass, bell pepper and green bean aromas swirl around the bouquet on this fresh, coastal SB. This feels round yet crisp, with modest acidic cut and flavors or orange, passion fruit and minerals. Finishing flavors are similar, with a hint of green herb.",89,22.0
3791,Louis Latour,"Firm from the start, the wine then shows both ripe red-berry fruit and a dense structure. There's an herbal edge that will soften in the next 2–3 years, bringing out the richness of Chambolle.",89,80.0
3792,Louis Latour,"Soft and rounded, this has an open, fragrant character. It has ripe flavors of strawberries and red plums, with a touch of wood and delicious, fresh acidity. Only on the finish does the structured side show through.",89,35.0
3793,Wines & Winemakers,"This rich, sophisticated wood-aged wine has complex fruits, structure and tannins. Ripe, juicy black fruits are intertwined with a solidly dry texture, powerful but still elegant. It will repay aging. Drink from 2016.",91,17.0
3794,Wines & Winemakers,"A rich wine that is made by the Abreu Callado charity foundation. It has dark black currant fruits, big tannins and an elegant feel. With its structure, minerality and ripe, juicy fruitiness, it is finely structured and ageworthy. Drink from 2017.",91,22.0
3795,Undurraga,"This Chardonnay is generally solid. However, on the nose, palate and finish you'll find a briny, almost pickled character to go with aromas of citrus fruits, flavors of melon and apple, and finishing notes of melon and lime. All in all, there's not a lot to this wine.",84,13.0
3796,Bründlmayer,"Very supple, easy notes of ripe apple and ripe green pear make for a charming, superfresh and slender white. Immensely approachable in fruitiness, but not in the least facile. It treads lightly but has subtle impact and tender, fruity length.",92,32.0
3797,Columbia Crest,"This off-dry wine falls on the sweet side, with pleasant honey/lemon tea flavors up front. The fruit is followed with some earthier notes, and a quickly fading finish.",85,8.0
3798,Kunde,"Lemondrop, buttered toast and vanilla cream flavors mark this soft, opulent Chardonnay. It becomes a little cloying on the finish.",85,17.0
3799,Wines & Winemakers,"Attractive and herbaceous, this has an apple flavor that's laced with a citrus note. Fresh and crisp, it's fruity, forward and can be consumed now.",86,
3800,Testarossa,"Buttery vanilla and baked cherry aromas make for a pretty and plump entry to this bottling from a vineyard in the heart of the appellation. Approachable plum and cherry flavors meet baking spice on the palate, the texture soft and acidity ample.",90,65.0
3801,Foxen,"This old-vines wine is really clean and light on the nose, with aromas of red apple, fresh-cut white sapote and blanched almonds. The laser-focused palate is dominated by a refreshing texture, like sipping an ice-cold martini or licking a steel knife, with sea salt and lemon peel flavors most prevalent.",92,25.0
3802,Chehalem,"Young and visibly spritzy, this appealing wine bursts forth with scents of lemon tea and orange blossoms, followed by flavors of orange soda, candied pineapple and stone fruits. It's round and fruity, definitely sweet, but kept lively with plenty of acid and that tongue-tickling spritz.",90,24.0
3803,Feudi di San Gregorio,"From vineyards near the dangerous Vesuvius volcano, this crisp white wine is direct, clean, easy-going and food friendly. It opens with citrus, tangerine and stone fruit aromas.",86,17.0
3804,DFJ Vinhos,"This is deeply colored and rich, showing both the juicy fruit character of Alicante Bouschet and a more serious, concentrated element. It's solid and densely tannic, with wood flavors layered on its black plum fruit. This is worth aging for another two years.",91,13.0
3805,V. Sattui,"Basically a dessert wine because it jumps beyond the off-dry line into overtly sweet. Shows pastry-filling flavors of apricots and pineapples, with rich vanilla and smoky honey overtones.",86,24.0
3806,Wines & Winemakers,"A crisp blend of Fernão Pires, Arinto and some herbal Sauvignon Blanc, this light and fruity wine is tangy, zingy and packed with lemon and ripe pear flavors. Its acidity shines through to produce a wine that is bright and ready to drink.",86,12.0
3807,Louis Jadot,"Rich, juicy and packed with both wood flavors and delicious red fruits, this concentrated and dense wine has a wonderful sense of freshness. There is a strong mineral texture, with tannins that come from ripe fruit as well as wood. The whole wine is finished with acidity, spice and a full-bodied, rich aftertaste.",93,135.0
3808,Louis Jadot,"With big, ripe fruits, this powerful wine oozes rich plum and spice flavors. It is dark and intense, concentrated with both acidity and wood aging. A line of freshness gives this dense wine an impressive lift of raspberry and red currant flavors. Drink from 2021.",93,122.0
3809,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"Still way too young, this is developing into a substantial and structured wine. Full of both fruit and tannins, it is dark and dense, very dry at this stage but with the most enticing perfumes. The Grand Cru, split between Chambolle-Musigny and Morey Saint-Denis, is known for its structure and this wine is a great example. Drink from 2020.",93,463.0
3810,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"Honeyed notes of pear promise oriental richness. The palate cuts this opulence, edged with Seville orange spice and a streak of zesty lime. This interplay between baroque and discipline continues, creating a scintillating experience. Enjoy the ride and marvel at all the spicy overtones.",93,60.0
3811,Foxen,"Fresh raspberry and Bing cherry juice meet with wet black slate, rain on cement and toasted sagebrush scents on the nose of this block-selection expression. The palate opens with ripe red berry, then tightens on slightly sour cranberries, with singing acidity down the middle and a warmer anise tinge to the edges.",93,58.0
3812,Gary Farrell,"This floral wine opens as if in a damp but not wet forest, surrounded by ripe, red cherry trees. Likable from the start, it's grippy on the palate, expressively juicy, seductive and refined. Blackberry and dried herb pop on the finish, providing a darker side to the red fruit.",93,55.0
3813,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Thanks to its large case production, this crisp Greco di Tufo should be easy to locate at your local wine store or supermarket. It offers a wonderful introduction to southern Italian, volcanic soil winemaking thanks to drying mineral tones, pear and apple.",88,20.0
3814,Montes,"Smells strange, with aromas that are hard to identify or label. The palate is tangy, with pickled, resiny flavors and a dead-end finish. Suggestive of sauerkraut; not very good Chardonnay.",82,12.0
3815,Concha y Toro,"Smells green and weedy at first, and then oak aromas rise up to cover the green overriding character. Clacky in the mouth, with green-leaning berry flavors and oak. Finishes herbal, with a lasting flavor of pole bean.",82,12.0
3816,DFJ Vinhos,"This is a soft wine that seems removed from the tight, mineral Alvarinhos found further north in Portugal. It has a smooth texture, the acidity lying easily over the ripe apple flavor. Drink from 2016.",86,15.0
3817,V. Sattui,"Aromas like petrol and turned earth along with fruity, very sweet flavors make an interesting combination in this luscious dessert-style wine.",88,45.0
3818,Maryhill,"This is a rather light wine in both density, flavor and impact. Some dilute citrus fruit flavors are framed with the lightest hint of cracker. Drink it chilled or use it as a mixer.",85,10.0
3819,Santa Ema,"Barrel notes and outright wood resin are the aromas that dominate. In the mouth, it's a blend of sharp acidity, citrus zest and cidery astringency. Woody flavors match the bouquet, while an apple note pops up late. On the finish, this tastes wheaty and woody.",85,24.0
3820,Louis Jadot,"While there is plenty of acidity in this wine, it also has red fruit character that conveys a ripe, full feeling. It's juicy and fruity, crisp but still warm at the end.",85,14.0
3821,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"Faint notes of ripe pear rise from the glass. The palate comes in with fresh zestiness—it is dry and slender but has lip-smacking citrus freshness of grapefruit and tangerine. This is bundled, full of invigorating appetizing freshness. There is something bracingly clean but also harmonious about the finish.",92,30.0
3822,Louis Jadot,"From the grandest of Burgundy's white vineyards, this Le Montrachet sums up the 2006 white vintage. Its structure, freshness and richness rolls the wine around the mouth, offering citrus, bitter orange and yellow fruit flavors. Toast flavors round the wine, leaving a hugely satisfying aftertaste.",96,
3823,Louis Latour,"Rich and mineral at the same time, this deliciously powerful wine is open and generous. The structure is equally impressive, a steely core of minerality and tense stone fruits. The wood shows through with spice, but remains discreet. Age for many years.",96,
3824,Louis Latour,"Power, density, huge richness—all the attributes you would expect from a Corton-Charlemagne. But, this being 2006, the ripe tropical fruits are crispened with acidity which cuts through the impressive opulence and ripeness.",95,
3825,Louis Jadot,"Very rich, this is all about structure and pure elegance. Flavors are of fresh white fruits with touches of green pepper, alongside honey, lemon and crisp sweetness. A wine for aging.",94,
3826,Louis Jadot,"A big, fat and rich wine, with tropical fruit flavors. There is spice from the prominent wood with an edge of vanilla. It's a powerhouse of a Chardonnay, ripe and full, the acidity lending crispness to the finish.",94,
3827,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"This is undeniably a concentrated wine offering a complex set of very appealing aromas and flavors (singed grapefruit peel, honey, caramel). However, it is a bit out of balance at 15.5% alcohol and finishes shorter than one has a right to expect in this triple-digit price range. It's starting to show some development and will probably not improve, so best to drink up soon.",89,110.0
3828,Kunde,"Fig and fennel star in this block-designated white that is crisp and fresh around a medium-strength body. Ready for the table, it finishes quick and clean.",88,25.0
3829,Trapiche,"Leathery berry aromas are earthy and come with toasty oak. A round, flush, jammy palate brings plum, wild berry and resiny oak flavors in front of a forward, lively, oaky finish that's drying and resiny.",88,18.0
3830,DFJ Vinhos,"A firm, tannic wine with elegant structure. The red fruits from the Merlot are a great foil for the tannins of the Touriga Franca. Even at five years, this is still fruit dominated, although the wood and spice element is well integrated.",88,
3831,Trapiche,"Tangerine and citrus aromas give the bouquet an orangey element, and there's a pinch of oak and tarragon in there as well. The palate has a mild, buttery texture and creamy flavors of peach and apple. Honeyed and creamy on the simple finish.",85,10.0

3834,Montes,"A nose of creamy pear and apple aromas carries a citric edge, while citrus leads the palate, with vanilla and resin in support. The feel is round and medium-bodied, with modest oak making itself noticed on the palate and finish. In the end there's more wood than pure fruit. Better than acceptable but that's as far as it goes.",84,12.0
3835,Bründlmayer,"From vines trained on the lyre system, here is one of the classics of Austrian wine. Its richness and concentration are present from the first taste. As the wine opens, it brings out perfumes and intense fruit flavors. A great wine that needs long-term aging.",95,74.0
3836,Bründlmayer,"A rich wine, very balanced with ripe peach flavors enlivened by acidity, orange zest and an edge of spice. The wine is lush while also mineral and will likely develop over the next 3–4 years. The aftertaste is gorgeous and very ripe.",94,
3837,Williams Selyem,"Masses of lemondrop candy, pineapple tart and mashed ripe pears in this marvelous wine, but that's not all. Buttered toast, crème brûlée, bananas sautéed in butter and brown sugar are some of the additional complexities. That makes the wine sound sweet, but it finishes dry. High in alcohol, but balanced, this flamboyant Chardonnay is best enjoyed now.",94,50.0
3838,Santa Ema,"Generic black fruit aromas are accompanied by mocha, heat and lemony oak. Feels tannic and choppy, with herbal berry fruit flavors. Lively but pointed and jagged on the finish.",84,10.0

3844,Trapiche,"This is oakier and more expensive than prior Trapiche Chardonnays, but it's not necessarily better. It smells like a rubber band and a barrel, bearing resiny flavors of mango and melon, with lots of sweet oak and vanilla tones.",84,25.0
3845,V. Sattui,"There's an unripe, green edge to this Zinfandel that detracts from its appeal. Yet it has some good blackberry fruit, and it's nicely dry and tannic. Pair this with rich meats and cheeses to coax out the sweetness.",84,35.0
3846,DFJ Vinhos,"This is a rounded, full-bodied rosé that also has a herbal element. It has a wild strawberry flavor, with light acidity and sweetness. Screwcap.",83,6.0

3857,Georges Duboeuf,"On the austere side, as befits a wine from the highest vineyards in Beaujolais, this is also balanced and elegant. It shows black berry fruits, a firm edge of tannins as well as delicious juicy flavors.",88,
3858,Louis Latour,"While there are tannins, they are not as powerful as the appellation and year would suggest. Instead, there is bright acidity, strawberry flavors and a fresh feel.",88,120.0
3859,Undurraga,"Stocky yet comported up front, this dark-colored Carmenère pumps out blackberry aromas along with notes of dried herbs and desert brush. A full but balanced palate deals toasty, blackened plum and spice flavors in front of a finish with ample oak and baking-spice notes.",89,18.0

3863,Trapiche,"After light scents of butter and spiced apple surface, the wine turns briny and pickled, both in aromas and flavors. It feels fleshy on the finish, with briny stone-fruit and citrus flavors.",82,10.0

3866,Casa Santos Lima,"This structured and dense wine hails from the steep, sloping hills of the Lisboa region. While aged in Portuguese oak, which provides spice and dark tannins, the delicious black fruit core is not overpowered. Drink now–2016.",90,10.0
3867,Chanson Père et Fils,"Dark in color, this is a rich, opulent, almost showy wine. The fruit is ripe, a combination of the sweetest strawberries with black cherries, laced with rich acidity.

Just fabulous, and a terrifically versatile food wine.",95,38.0
3869,Foxen,"This bottling by veteran Foxen offers one of the starkest, most appealing choices available in California Chardonnay. Far from a superripe buttery monster, it's a lean, elegant machine. With vibrant acidity and a mineral undergirding, it offers rich flavors of citrus fruits and rind and yeasty, Champagne-like lees.",94,32.0
3870,Chanson Père et Fils,"A complete wine that speaks of both richness and terroir. While the tannins are certainly there, they are dominated by rich black fruits, ripeness, power and concentration. It is the sort of wine that reveals many layers of flavor and complexity. Age for five years.",94,85.0
3871,Robert Mondavi,"This is a very fine, high level Cabernet that shows the impeccable nature of Mondavi Reserve. Yet it's also very tannic and far from being drinkable. Shows a vast repository of black currant, blackberry, black cherry and new oak flavors wrapped into a smooth, velvety mouthfeel whose finish goes on forever. Masculine and authoritative, it should continue to improve for many years. Drink now, with decanting, and through 2017, at least.",94,135.0
3872,Williams Selyem,"This is the best value of the winery's spring lineup of seven 2012 Pinot Noirs. It's dry, delicate, modest in alcohol, tart and complex.

3873,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Made from organically grown grapes, it boasts a floral fragrance of chamomile, white flower, beeswax and tropical fruit. The structured, elegant palate delivers grapefruit, nectarine, peach and mineral accented with aromatic herbs. Can be held for more complexity; drink now through 2020.",92,37.0
3874,Albert Bichot,"A firm wine that has ripe but structured tannins. It is not a big wine, but rather shows a tighter style of Pinot Noir that balances sweet red fruits and a spice edge of wood. It would benefit from aging for 2–3 years.",88,
3875,Chanson Père et Fils,"Tense and dark, this has firm, dry tannins that overlay black plum skin and black fig flavors. The wine shows richness but also a foursquare solid structure and weight that is balanced by a final sweet, satisfying juicy acidity.",88,70.0
3876,Louis Latour,The wine is structured with solid tannins and a foursquare character. Ripe fruits with plenty of balancing acidity give this wine its density and its crisp edge. This is a fruity wine that will develop slowly and well. Drink from 2020.,91,79.0
3877,Casa Santos Lima,"This dark, intense wine is solid with rich tannins and brooding black fruits.

There is a luscious aftertaste that is both immediately appealing and opulent. Drink now.",88,30.0

3879,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"Deep gold in color. Complex nose, very earthy, savory, minerally aromas showing some evolution. Rich, viscous and broad across the palate with a strong savory, almost vegetal palette of flavors, some spice. Slightly lacking in freshness and fruit. Full-bodied with a warm, round finish.",89,48.0
3880,Kunde,"This is a nicely balanced wine from estate-grown vines, a mix of licorice and raspberry that offers luxurious mouthfeel and texture atop surprising acidity. A small amount of Viognier was used in fermentation to provide some additional lift and floral aromas, while a dustiness prevails on the finish.",90,25.0
3881,Testarossa,"This very elegant nose is like a love potion perfume of violet, sterling rose, myrrh and raspberry essence. The flavors veer toward tart raspberry and cranberry, with cola and purple flowers coming through before a brisk acidic finish.",92,61.0
3882,Testarossa,"Lemongrass, honeysuckle, Gala apple and light caramel show on the riper nose of this bottling from the Los Gatos-based winery. Every-so-slight marshmallow flavors rise on the palate alongside jasmine and wet riverstone. The texture is chalky.",90,
3883,Montes,"The nose is light and attractive, with peach and floral accents. The mouth is perfectly smooth, with apple, melon and a hint of flint or steel.

3885,Montes,"From the Apalta Vineyard in Colchagua, this robust, fruity Merlot is rich and sweet, and offers a fine mesh of blueberry and black raspberry fruit.

3886,Concha y Toro,"If you love overt oak, then add a couple of points to this plump, modern Chard that runs over with the aromas, flavors and textures that stem from new-oak barrels. The bouquet is mostly popcorn atop apple and pear, while the flavor profile is ripe apple and banana. The finish is soft and creamy, with flavors of lemon and fresh-cut wood. Fine acidity and balance work in its favor.",88,33.0
3887,V. Sattui,"A juicy, herb-tinged wine expressive in dusty, just-ripe blackberry, Paradiso combines Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec, all aged in 80% new French oak for 19 months. Full bodied and oaky, it has a lasting taste of chocolate.",87,85.0
3888,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Made entirely with native grape Greco, this sparkler from southern Italy features aromas of lemon blossom, chamomile and yeasty notes of bread crust.

3889,Chanson Père et Fils,"In this generous interpretation of Nuits Saint-Georges, ripe berry fruits burst through the typical dry tannins. It has plenty of red-fruit flavors, a generous texture and structure. Drink this already attractive wine from 2018.",88,77.0
3890,Undurraga,"Hard, rubbery blackberry and black-currant flavors are herbal but settle with airing. This feels round, fresh and fair. Flavors of spiced plum, blackberry, carob and generic spices finish dark and foresty, with good overall balance.",88,17.0
3891,Santa Ema,"This opens with a blast of bell pepper and leafy berry aromas. The palate is juicy but scratchy, while flavors of plum, raspberry and herbs finish tart, with no evolution.",83,10.0
3892,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"The aromas are bright, with notes of guava, pineapple and citrus. The palate is lightly spritzy with plenty of grapefruit flavors that keep the interest high.",88,10.0
3893,Fess Parker,"Ripe banana, coconut, mango and guava aromas make for a showy entry in this bottling, but citrusy freshness keeps it in check. The palate show a clean line of lemony acidity that sears into the finish, cutting through hints of more tropical fruit.",88,19.0
3894,Columbia Crest,"Vineyard designated Cabernet Francs are an extreme rarity in the state. This one brings aromas of plum, herb, vanilla and pencil lead that are followed by pillow-soft fruit flavors. The variety doesn't always show through but it provides enjoyment.",90,40.0
3895,Montes,"This is opaque in color, with oaky, balsamic aromas of black fruits, mint and vanilla. In the mouth, this is muscular, with full and somewhat rough tannins. Toasty roasted blackberry flavors are peppery, minty and fully spiced, while on the finish this is packing all sorts of power and oak. Drink through 2021.",90,23.0
3896,Lynmar,"Inviting aromas of honeysuckle make way for an unctuous, voluptuous palate of smooth, ripe apple, fig and pear flavors in this vineyard designate. Full-bodied and concentrated in style, it has a high-toned hint of lemon zest that peaks on the finish.",91,60.0
3897,Albert Bichot,"This is a smoky, fragrant wine that offers dense fruit and firm tannins. It has the structure of a fine Gevrey and the concentration of the vintage. This is classic and worth aging for 4–5 years.",89,

3902,DFJ Vinhos,"Firm and ripe, with dense, juicy fruit, this shows the exuberant side of Touriga Nacional. It has solid tannins, but the fruit is full of bright berries, herbs and a touch of pepper. The wood aging has rounded the fruit out.",90,17.0
3903,V. Sattui,"Give this Zin extra points for sheer power. The vineyard consists of two parcels in St. Helena that date to the 1930s or earlier. It's a tremendous wine, dry, full-bodied and strong in alcohol, with blackberry, blueberry, red currant, licorice, black pepper and cedar flavors.",92,39.0
3904,Williams Selyem,"With ample power under its engine, this Ferrington Vineyard Pinot is rich in cranberry and red cherry, soft and lilting in texture yet nuanced in toasty oak. Big on the finish, it'll beautifully withstand a few more years on its own before opening, the acidity lively enough to keep flavors vibrant yet mellowed.",92,65.0
3905,Siduri,"The vineyard is in a cooler part of the valley, and shows its terroir in the acid-driven sour-cherry candy and persimmon flavors. The texture is delicately silky, and the finish is complex in spices, with that acidity lingering long. Cellar it until 2018, at the very least.",92,48.0

3907,Chanson Père et Fils,"This is a young, perfumed wine with attractive red fruits. While the wood is showing at the moment, that will fade as the wine develops, giving a fresh, raspberry-dominated wine. Drink from 2018.",88,34.0
3908,Chanson Père et Fils,"This wine is ripe, full of yellow fruits that are balanced with crisp acidity. That gives a balanced wine that is juicy, perfumed and rich. The aftertaste is equally attractive, showing lemon-zest flavor.",88,25.0
3909,Fess Parker,"Smoky notes of roasted meat and white pepper spice up the plum skins and blackberry fruit that show on the nose of this bottling.

3912,Williams Selyem,"This is a seductive and deeply satisfying Pinot Noir, light in rose petal and red cherry notes and yet intense and voluptuous in texture.

3913,Williams Selyem,"Tight-grained tannin wraps around dark, brooding swathes of black cherry, blackberry and cinnamon; dustings of dark chocolate and graham cracker weaving their way underneath. Strong herbal components balance the fruit and complexity, brightened by dashes of fresh citrus and herb.",94,55.0
3914,Williams Selyem,"It's easy to appreciate this wine's generous, almost jammy aromas. They're followed by spicy, concentrated black-cherry flavors backed by firm acidity and lots of fine-grained tannins. This wine, from a vineyard owned by Williams-Selyem co-founder Burt Williams, tastes terrific now, but will show more complexity with time. Try to save it until at least 2018.",94,78.0
3915,Siduri,"Elegant purple flower, black cherry fruit, a bouquet of white sage and a touch of graphite decorate the rich and vibrant nose of this wine by Adam Lee.

3919,Iron Horse,"First made for the historic summits between Reagan and Gorbachev in 1985, this blend of 69% Pinot Noir and 31% Chardonnay marks the 30th anniversary of that event.

3923,Wines & Winemakers,"Castelão thrives in the sandy soils of the Palmela appellation. This reserve wine from 60-year-old vines with 12 months in wood is a rich, structured example. It's full bodied and ripe, packed with black plum fruit and acidity. Still young, it's ready to drink but will be better from 2018.",91,18.0
3924,Lynmar,"This powerfully built, youthful wine was made from coastal fruit grown in Susanna's Vineyard. Brawny and smoky, it offers a concentrated black-cherry note that takes on a refined, baked quality. The fruit is cradled in soft, seductive acidity and a hint of leather.",94,85.0
3925,Siduri,"Expansive on the palate, with lively acidity, this is robust, ripe and complex. Its powerful core of strawberry-rhubarb fruit is layered with forest pine, rose, and crushed rock notes, the texture velvety thick but balanced.",94,50.0
3926,Columbia Crest,"Smelling like a fresh bowl of fruit, this blend of co-fermented Syrah (73%), Grenache (20%) and Viognier provides pure aromas of blueberries, raspberries, smoked meat, fresh flowers and orange peel. The oak (30% new French) is dialed back, letting the fresh, light and appealing texture and sweet fruit flavors shine.",92,35.0
3927,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,This is a creamy wine with soft fruitiness. The roundness is happily cut with acidity and with a citrus edge that lifts the melon and pear flavors. The aftertaste is tangy and zesty. Drink now.,87,25.0
3928,Columbia Crest,"Off-dry with lemon-drop fruit flavors, a lick of citrus that suggests pear and lime. Though it's a fairly simple, fruit-forward wine, it delivers a concentrated burst of fresh, vivid flavor that's missing from most wines in this price range.",87,8.0
3929,Albert Bichot,"As a Corton-Charlemagne should be, this is big and opulent. The minerality is quite present, a fresh addition to a wine that has more to do with ripe, racy tropical and yellow fruits that fill the mouth. It is not a wine for aging, maybe 2–3 years, but is certainly delicious now.",93,
3930,Albert Bichot,"Big, fruity ripe wine that also keeps the flinty, mineral nature of fine Chablis. The texture is creamy, with wood over peaches and apricots. But the acidity cuts through this rounded fruit like a sharp knife, giving shape and preserving the true freshness of the wine.",93,
3931,Chehalem,"Lightly dusted with cinnamon and baking spices, this is apple pie in a glass. Along with the lovely apple-pastry richness come lighter suggestions of pear and peach. This immaculate and substantial effort should be consumed now through 2017.",92,22.0
3932,Chehalem,"This is a terrific vintage for this blend, helped by the decision to bump up the alcohol and reduce the residual sugar, now down to 16g/L. Though off dry, this retains a spine of steely acid, highlighting the bright and spicy lemon curd, orange peel and pink grapefruit flavors. It will be delicious with pork roasts or simply sipped with mild cheeses.",92,22.0
3933,Columbia Crest,"This fruit did not attain full ripeness in 2011, at least as far as this single-vineyard bottling would suggest. It's thin in the mouth, with considerable herbal character. Though balanced in terms of tannin and acid, the finish feels dilute.",87,30.0
3934,Louis Jadot,"Firm and surprisingly complex for a Beaujolais, this is rich, ripe and deliciously full of cherry and red plum fruits. It's asking to age into 2015, to bring out full pleasure of its fruitiness.",87,14.0

3937,Montes,"One of Chile's ripest, most full-bodied Syrahs needs more time to fully strut its stuff. Aromas of graphite and coconut are prominent on a lush, boldly fruited bouquet. A highly concentrated palate allows for deep digging, while flavors of blackberry, black plum and raw oak turn savory and spicy as this breathes. An inky, powerful finish is appropriate. Drink through 2022.",93,90.0
3938,Maryhill,"This brings light flavors of leaf and hard cherry candy, with a hint of cola.After its quick start, the wine tails off gently.",84,20.0
3939,Robert Mondavi,"Classic and restrained, with herbal components and a firm tannic backbone, this is a finely made wine at a respectable price that's easy to enjoy and share. Savory currant, leather and oak define it best.",88,28.0
3940,Santa Ema,"Something's definitely not clicking with this wine. It has sweet, heavy beet and horseradish aromas, and there's a burnt harshness to the whole package. The palate shows a hard scour as well, with sour, strange, underdeveloped flavors. Just a tough, heavy wine with little charm.",81,12.0
3941,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"This well-defined Cabernet offers blackberry, black cherry and a hint of sweet grape jam. It's set in a frame of rock and tannin, that seems to catch and hold as it enters the back of the throat. Perhaps an indication that more bottle age, or some hours of decanting, are in order? In any event, it stops a bit short.",88,28.0
3942,Columbia Crest,"The Grand Estates Merlot holds center court in the vast Columbia Crest portfolio. This new release, which has received extra bottle age, is seamless, smoky, supple and seductive. Exotic sandalwood and Asian spices weave from the nose into the palate, wrapped around broad black cherry and blackberry fruit flavors. A darker streak of black olive and licorice runs into a finish replete with tannins that are tight and hint at stem.",88,12.0
3943,Georges Duboeuf,"A finely structured wine that has firm tannins to go with the ripe juicy red fruits. Bitter cherry and crisp acidity fit easily together, while the dry core comes out strongly in the aftertaste.",88,
3944,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"A clean-cut top note of citrus hovers above the otherwise still-closed nose. The palate comes in with a concentrated richness that is as much sustained by residual sweetness as it is by sheer force of fruit: candied lemon and orange, juicy pear, ripe mirabelle and yellow peach. There also is a zesty spicy pithiness on the midpalate that frames and guides the wine alongside invigorating lemon freshness that lets this finish off dry despite the richness. This is yet to unfold fully. Lovely now, sure to improve. Drink 2020—2035.",95,80.0
3945,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"Funky notions of yeast still cloud the nose. The palate gives us tense, concentrated lemon and tangerine zest at first but you feel that there is more strength, almost raw force, at the core of this that still needs to develop and work out its balance. This is a big wine, energetic and dry, intense and generous but not yet fully fledged. Drinking it now would rob it of its as of yet untapped essence. For now it is lemon purity that holds sway but there will be so much more. Cellar from 2022–2035, at least.",95,80.0
3946,Georges Duboeuf,"A lean wine, all tannins and missing the fruit. It has acidity, a smoky character, but there is a hollow feel to it.",84,15.0
3947,Georges Duboeuf,"Rich and perfumed, the wine is packed with black cherry and damson fruit flavors. It is concentrated with its tannins firmly integrated, giving great final fruit and ripeness.",90,14.0
3948,Georges Duboeuf,"Impressively powerful, structured wine that has spice, richness, plenty of firm tannins as well as a punch of sweet plum and red cherry flavors. There is an edge of acidity that suggests aging potential.",90,16.0
3949,Foxen,"Heavy and rich, as Pinots from this vineyard tend to be. Also exceptionally ripe, with massive cherry marmalade and smoky, sweet oak flavors. Feels young and direct and easy to drink, with a fruity sweetness. Glamorous, but the price seems out of line.",90,80.0
3950,Georges Duboeuf,"Very firmly tannic, still young and needing another year to age. The red berry fruits are present, layered with the tannins and acidity. The wine has structure, plenty of freshness, finishing with cherry acidity.",90,
3951,Georges Duboeuf,"A firmly terroir-driven wine, solidly based on its tannins and the richest of red fruits. Very mineral, chewy at this young stage, densely concentrated, the acidity a sharp light through the fruit. Powerful stuff.",90,14.0
3952,Fess Parker,"This is an excellent Central Coast Chardonnay, from a cool, coastally influenced growing region. Browned butter, sea salt, nectarine and vanilla meet with sharp lemony freshness on the nose, while the medium-bodied palate is familiar and easy to quaff.",92,40.0
3953,Gary Farrell,"From the heart of the Laguna de Santa Rosa, this vineyard-designate delights in rhubarb and strawberry, hugely pleasing in fresh fruitiness. Complexity builds in its salty undertones and bright, sharp teases of blood orange and lemon, while the backbone is strong in floral-driven minerality.",92,60.0
3954,Montes,"Like many Chilean Pinots, this starts out funky as a three-legged llama. The bouquet pumps bramble, dusty country road and roasted berry fruit. But with time it settles and unfolds, and in the end there's sweet herbal fruit flavors along with spice and vanilla. Voilà! It's honest PN from Chile.",87,16.0
3955,Columbia Crest,"Strong scents of vanilla and fresh-baked pastry inform this wine, with a floral, lightly soapy character to the aromas. It is pleasant enough, but fades quickly.",85,15.0
3956,Wines & Winemakers,"This blend of Jaén, Alfrocheiro, Touriga Nacional and Tinta Roriz is ripe and juicy, with black fruit tones. It does have a structure that will allow the wine to age for a few years, so drink from late 2016.",88,12.0
3957,Santa Ema,"This is roasted and meaty smelling. What the nose holds back is revealed on the palate, which is rugged, aggressive and tight as nails, with boisterous plum, berry, menthol and chocolate flavors. Coconut and chocolate-mint flavors come up on the power-packed finish.",87,85.0
3958,Trapiche,"Tight and intense for a $10 varietal, with crusty, charred oak aromas on top of ripe berry fruit. The palate is thick and full, with clamping tannins and flavors of lemony oak, plum and blackberry. Vanilla and mocha work the woody finish.",86,10.0
3959,Louis Latour,"Soft and rich, with vanilla and quince flavors. A very round, open wine, with only a hint of structure.",87,
3960,Siduri,"Damp forest floor give this wine a strong character of earthiness and wintery, savory notes, surrounded by intense black cherry, oak and firm, sizable tannins. Enjoyable now, the wine also shows promise for the future, able to relax through 2020.",90,49.0
3961,Gary Farrell,"Crisp acidity buoys sharp red fruit in this delectable wine—a blend of multiple sites across the appellation. Medium build, it shows youthful tannins and oak that supports without intrusion, allowing the crunch of cranberry, strawberry and pomegranate to speak forcefully.",94,45.0
3962,Iron Horse,"Extra dry in style, this sparkling blend of 68% Pinot Noir and 32% Chardonnay succeeds dramatically in its ability to be salty as a cracker and crisp as a bite of green apple, followed by a lemon chaser. Tart and lengthy, it has persistent acidity and purity that's hard to resist.",94,52.0
3963,Robert Mondavi,"Shows everything that's noble about Oakville, from the wonderful, dusty tannins to the dryness and overall balance. Lovely, with flavors of blackberries, black currants and cedar. Could have more depth, though.",89,45.0
3964,Iron Horse,"Iron Horse's 2011 Chardonnays are all fine in their own ways, but this Estate bottling seems to combine many of their best qualities in a single wine. With ripe orange, pear, apple and smoky oak flavors accented by brisk acidity, it shows the Iron Horse signature of elegant balance.",91,28.0
3965,Georges Duboeuf,"All red cherry and banana fruit, this is a soft, juicy and bright wine. Attractive and fresh, just edged with a slightly dry texture.",84,11.0
3966,Georges Duboeuf,"There is a layer of tannins here that impart a dry edge to what is otherwise sweetly fruity wine. It is full and juicy, with strawberry fruit flavors.",84,10.0
3967,Trapiche,"Cassis, sugar beet, leather and mild herbal aromas make this Cabernet appealing on the nose. It feels slightly syrupy and resiny, but with its core acidity the palate remains in good shape. Flavors of plum and cassis have a strong vanilla and oak resin accent, while the finish is tannic, roasted and robust.",88,15.0
3968,Bründlmayer,"A superb wine, the product of a great vineyard site and old vines. The wine is concentrated, very rich, beautifully balanced between considerable acidity and sweet white fruits and mandarin oranges. With its tense, edgy texture, it is a wine that will age for many years.",96,80.0
3969,Albert Bichot,"This is a structured wine, almost tannic in character. It has a rich, textured character that will allow the wine well. Apple and pear flavors are dominant along with the spice from wood aging. Drink from 2020.",93,115.0
3970,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"A flinty nose of citrus purity hints that this still requires bottle age, but all the elements of a great wine are present. It offers a bundled concentration of flavor and fruit, and a straight backbone of acidity pervades everything with a sense of purity. Right now, fresh citrus notes of lemon pith, peel and flesh dominate aromatically, but this will blossom. There are already inklings of honey and orange in the background but only time will reveal what cabinet of wonders is hidden here. Drink 2017–2025.",93,55.0
3971,Gary Farrell,"The fruit from this marquee site is elusive at first, offering light wisps of rose petal and bay, earthy and spicy in equal waves. Around its richness of tart cherry are elements of pomegranate, orange zest and tea. It's a wine of great complexity and counterbalance, with a lengthy, leathery finish.",93,60.0
3972,Albert Bichot,"This is a structured wine, almost tannic in character. It has a rich, textured character that will allow the wine well. Apple and pear flavors are dominant along with the spice from wood aging. Drink from 2020.",93,115.0
3973,Albert Bichot,"This is a premier cru with a single owner, described as a Monopole in French. It has ripe tannins backed with hints of smokiness. The fruit lies behind the structure, with its powerful, dense character. Hints of the juicy, black-fruit future of this wine come through the texture. Drink from 2022.",93,120.0
3974,Chanson Père et Fils,"This is a firm wine, full of tannins as well as plenty of ripe berries. It is concentrated, juicy and perfumed, an attractive wine already. The dry core gives structure to this panoply of fruitiness. The name comes from French king Louis XI who acquired the vineyard in the 15th century.",93,68.0
3975,Chanson Père et Fils,"This is a rich and rounded wine, full of yellow fruits that shine through the tense texture. It is ripe, showing minerality as well as tropical fruits and red apples. The wine is going to age relatively quickly, so drink from 2019.",93,91.0
3976,Chanson Père et Fils,"Rich in character, this is a dense wine, with smoky tannins and juicy red fruits that are deliciously ripe. The tannins and the fruit concentration result in a weighty yet brightly acidic wine. It will develop quickly, and then remain at a peak for many years. Drink from 2018.",93,69.0
3977,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Perfumed aromas of lime leaf, white peach and flowers are followed by an off-dry palate, chock full of stone-fruit flavors. Pair it with spicy Thai food.",88,9.0
3978,Testarossa,"Plump plum, blackberry and a bit of Christmas spice show on the fairly reserved and simple nose of this twist-top table wine. Tangy acidity enlivens the palate's dark red fruit, with a touch of oregano to add some nuance.",87,35.0
3979,Trapiche,"Grassy, green aromas are dull and fruitless. The palate is citric at first but then it collapses. Flavors of citrus and tarragon finish bland and with vegetal leanings.",82,15.0
3980,Wines & Winemakers,"Rich and soft, this Castelão-based rosé seems to miss out on freshness and acidity. Instead, it is broad, full in the mouth and heavy. It could work with food.",82,
3981,Columbia Crest,"Here again the Grand Estates bottling shows a softer, gentler side of the fruit; the acids seem to have been smoothed over. The fruit is ripe and clean, suggesting white peaches and green apples, but there isn't much depth to it.",85,11.0
3982,Maryhill,"This Chardonnay, Sémillon, Sauvignon Blanc and Viognier blend is a good, all-purpose white wine but lacks focus.",85,14.0
3983,Siduri,"Winemaker Adam Lee presents aromas of pressed elderberries and ripe black cherries on this single-vineyard bottling, boosted by hints of licorice and a touch of wet tobacco. Dark but not particularly ripe berries power the earthy palate, which also benefits from eucalyptus, sagebrush, mace and a hint of juniper.",91,49.0
3984,Siduri,"Baked red cherry, vanilla, cola and sarsaparilla show on the nose of this very approachable bottling by Adam Lee. There is a light touch of licorice to the sip, with strawberry and red-plum flavors as well as more complex touches of tea leaf and candied raspberry.",91,60.0
3985,Columbia Crest,"This exceptional effort is packed with sweet and tart fruits, beginning with lemon-lime, then moving through peaches and apricots and on into hints of papaya. Good length and splendid acidity.",90,12.0
3986,Kunde,"Very opulent, almost too much so, with a flood of Key lime pie, pineapple jam, orange, butterscotch and buttered toast flavors that overwhelm in richness. The saving grace is a fine structure of acidity and minerals and a finish that strives to be dry. Drink now with shellfish, roast pork, or all alone as an apéritif.",90,30.0
3987,Undurraga,"Rooty licorice, leather and olive aromas are solid, with pleasing berry scents. This feels plump, with a touch of tartaric acid popping up. Peppery plum and olive flavors are textbook for the variety, while the finish is forward and robust.",88,17.0
3988,Robert Mondavi,"Peppermint tea and eucalyptus combine on the bouquet, providing distinctiveness. High-strung rhubarb and orange follow suit, the overall experience in the glass light and bristling. Unique, this wine may not be for everyone, but is appealing nonetheless.",88,26.0
3989,Williams Selyem,"This bottling has been remarkably consistent over the last several vintages. Always exotic in lemondrop-candy fruit that's been well-oaked, it has nuances of flower petals, white peaches, minerals and honey. The '06 may be a little softer than past vintages.",90,50.0
3990,Williams Selyem,"This unusual and distinctive Zin has a silky texture and rich, finely ground tannins. The flavors range from classic black and red currants, mulberries, cloves and pepper to pastry flavors of coconut macaroon and fig cookie. Could easily develop over a decade.",89,48.0
3991,Williams Selyem,"One of the producer's more delicate offerings, this wine from a coastal site is crisp and crunchy in wet stone, black tea and light-bodied renderings of red cherry and pomegranate. Along the way it tells a tale of citrus tanginess and sculptured minerality, finishing with the slightest backbone of textured tannin.",94,95.0
3992,Williams Selyem,"Compared with the generally more delicate offerings from this producer, Bucher is always a standout. It's a raunchy, earthy barnyard expression of rustic cheese rind and dark cherry that symbolizes its origins in outstanding ways. Lively acidity keeps it fresh in the glass, while cardamon, rosemary and Asian spice provide the intrigue.",94,59.0
3993,Bründlmayer,There is a wonderful tang of orange zest in this fresh and fruit wine. With its attractive perfumes and flavors of currants it is ready to drink now but could age for a few years. Screwcap.,88,28.0
3994,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Pàtrimo, a pure expression of Merlot from southern Italy, is always a crowd pleaser, but this year's edition is a tad more ripe and jammy than past vintages: 2005 was indeed a hot year. Intense aromas of black cherry and blackberry pie emerge from the nose and the wine's finish is accented by a surprise signature of tart acidity.",88,150.0
3995,Feudi di San Gregorio,Rubrato is a clean and polished expression of Aglianico (stored in stainless steel instead of oak in order to preserve the freshness of the fruit) that would work with meatloaf or juicy cheeseburgers. It shows a smooth but firm quality in the mouth.,88,20.0
3996,Trapiche,"Brawny, toasty aromas prop up a sturdy oaky nose with a familiar dark-berry core. This Malbec is tightly wound, with wiry acidity. Flavors of blackberry, cassis, spiced plum, chocolate and cardamom finish earthy and mellow, with a lingering note of exotic spice. Drink through 2022.",91,45.0
3997,Siduri,"Bright, compressed fruit stars in this approachable and affordable Pinot Noir that's rounded with tannin and focused acidity. Cranberry, orange, cherry and cola flavors highlight its medium-bodied power and concentration.",91,35.0
3998,Testarossa,"From the vineyard owned by winemaker Bill Brosseau's family, this bottling shows black raspberry, strawberry, wet slate and rose petal scents on the nose. The palate is loaded with earthy black plum and other dark fruits, lifted by a star anise spiciness.",91,65.0
3999,Albert Bichot,This Bichot monopole has produced a round wine that's full of attractive plum flavor. It's backbone is buried in the sumptuous texture. Age this for at least four years.,91,
4000,Louis Jadot,"Perfumed, rich yet soft, this is opulent Beaune at its best. It has acidity and a touch of tannin, but it's the broad, ripe red-fruit flavors that dominate, which gives juiciness and vitality to this wine that will age for several years.",91,70.0
4001,Siduri,"Spice frames the bone-dry red fruit, which carries a sharp, astringent flavor profile into a rather short, tight finish. More cellar time might help to open this up further.",86,42.0
4002,Robert Mondavi,"Another fabulous I Block from Mondavi. Exceptionally ripe in grapefruit, lime and gooseberry fruit, it shows the minerality of this vineyard that gives the wine grip and grounding. Bone-dry, with crisp supportive acidity and just the right amount of oak, it's wonderful now. This is not a wine to age, but will hold over the next four years.",93,75.0
4003,Concha y Toro,"Opens with crusty, rock-solid aromas of mineral, shoe polish, herb and dense black fruit. This is a thick but smooth-bodied Cabernet with richness and sweet flavors of blackberry, cassis, fine herbes and brown sugar. Mild tannins, excellent structure and length define the finish. Drink now through 2016.",93,95.0
4004,Georges Duboeuf,"Bright and ripe, this deliciously fruity wine is lightly structured and has some weight. With its crisp acidity and dry core of tannins, it's a wine to pair with many foods.",86,13.0
4005,DFJ Vinhos,"This blackberry-flavored wine has ripe tannins and a soft texture. It presents a warm feeling, tempered by its fresher acidity and stalky aftertaste. Drink from late 2015.",85,8.0
4006,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"Faint notes of ripe pear rise from the glass. The palate comes in with fresh zestiness—it is dry and slender but has lip-smacking citrus freshness of grapefruit and tangerine. This is bundled, full of invigorating appetizing freshness. There is something bracingly clean but also harmonious about the finish.",92,30.0
4007,Chehalem,"This is dry, crisp and nicely detailed, with a persistent, clean and fresh mouthfeel. Notes of cucumber, salad greens and citrus, notably lime and grapefruit, are underscored with appealing minerality. This remains one of the highlights of Chehalem's expansive portfolio.",90,24.0
4008,Chanson Père et Fils,"This is a fruity wine with lively acidity and a brisk, zingy character. Freshness shoots through the wine, making it lively with hints of yellow fruits. The aftertaste is crisp and ripe.",89,36.0
4009,Concha y Toro,"Punchy citrus and minerally aromas open this fresh SB. A juicy, citric palate points in the right direction, while this tastes like tangerine and orange peel mixed with lime and green herbs. A crisp, persistent finish closes it out.",89,17.0
4010,Lynmar,"A splendid Chardonnay, rich, vital and elegant, with so many layers of interest. Framed by a cut of brilliant acidity, it evolves with complex flavors of citrus and tropical fruits, minerals, flowers and honey, then finishes long and savory in a swirl of spices. Oak adds the perfect touch of buttered toast, while the wine is a study in the creamy effect of sur lie aging. It's perfectly dry on the finish.",96,50.0
4011,Lynmar,"A bone dry wine that's rich in steely minerals and wonderful acidity. It offers the elegance and complexity of a great premier cru, with tantalizing traces of sweet Meyer lemons, limes and exotic spices. The oak is subtle, lending aromas and flavors of buttered toast, while its time spent on the lees contributes notes of sour cream. A fabulous success for this or any vintage.",95,40.0
4012,Fess Parker,"A shy, mineral-leaning nose offers pencil shavings and dark raspberry notes. The palate proves more dynamic, with sagebrush, red cherries and anise seed, showing lots of energy but nothing too complex.",88,30.0
4013,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Scents of orange blossom, tropical fruit and ripe apple emerge on this lively sparkler. Made with 100% Falanghina, the firm palate delivers nectarine zest, pineapple, green apple and a mineral vein alongside bright acidity and a vibrant, creamy mousse.",88,39.0
4014,Georges Duboeuf,"The beautiful estate of the Capitans of Juliénas has produced a smooth and rich wine. A good tannic structure partners with aromatic red cherry and berry fruits. Acidity is well in check, giving just the right freshness. Age the wine a bit more and drink from 2016.",88,22.0
4015,Georges Duboeuf,"Ripe and rounded, this soft wine is ready to drink. It has a fine shot of acidity as well as bitter cherry flavors. The finish is all juicy, refreshing fruit. Drink now.",88,
4016,Wines & Winemakers,"Produced from old vines, this is a serious and concentrated wine. It has a strong mineral texture that adds to the dark tannins to make a forceful structure. Powered by the structure and the black fruits it will age well. Start drinking in 2018.",91,40.0
4017,Siduri,"Soft and layered, this wine has firmness and depth to its structure, and is dark in brooding baked plum and cinnamon stick. A pungency of tight oak wraps its way around the fruit and savory spice, suggesting additional time in cellar, through 2023.",91,49.0
4018,Testarossa,"One of the more engaging single-vineyard expressions this winery makes from the region, this bottling by winemaker Bill Brousseau hits the nose with ripe black cherries, crushed slate, dried violets, purple Thai basil and light black licorice. Desiccated pomegranate tones lead the lush yet lively palate that is layered with peppery spice and a touch of herbs.",93,66.0
4019,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"Juicy apple notes, both ripe and tart, make for a crunchy and mouthwatering opening to this wine. The palate is clean and streaked with the zesty, balanced freshness of Amalfi lemon peel. Fluid and concentrated, the body will become more rounded with age, and there's already a hint of the candied lemon-peel richness at its core.",93,60.0
4020,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"Smoky glints of stone and ripe Mirabelle plum pervade the more usual notes of ripe pear. There is an earthy undertow but the palate sits serenely with its chiseled freshness and streamlined acidity. As you linger, every sip reveals different aspects of tart citrus, fresh-cut pear peel, ginger biscuits and chalky stone. The body is slender and dry.",93,55.0
4021,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"A flinty hint of reduction leads to a poised, juicy palate of tart apple, like a totally ripe Cox Orange Pippin, but utterly refreshing. Aromatic Amalfi lemon freshness offers more brightness while smoky glints add interest. There is a light touch here, leaving a fleetingly beautiful and yet lastingly memorable wine.",93,55.0
4022,Columbia Crest,"An uneasy mix of steel and butter, this may just need a bit more time to settle. At the moment, the twin elements of metal and popcorn clash and compete. For those who love the buttery style, this should prove pleasing.",86,12.0
4023,Kendall-Jackson,"This is a sumptuous, well-crafted wine, nearly 100% varietal and dark purple in color. It offers leathery chocolate and red cherry flavors around still-dense tannins that seem to soften in the glass. Given more than a year in oak, only a small percentage of it new, it's lively and refined.",90,26.0
4024,Maryhill,"Two-thirds of this wine comes from McKinley Springs Vineyard with the rest from Kiona and Les Collines. Coffee, pencil lead, barrel spice and high-toned herb aromas lead to full-bodied coffee and cherry flavors. The tannins show some grit and grip.",87,40.0
4025,Montes,"Nutty, honeyed apple and melon aromas come with plenty of raw wood grain. This is an oaky, resiny Chardonnay with just enough core acidity to maintain balance. Creamy apple and melon flavors finish on barrel-driven resin and cinnamon accents.",87,23.0
4026,Columbia Crest,"A restrained and somewhat backward reserve, this is hiding its fruit behind a dry, somewhat earthy, wall of tannin. There are interesting nuances of seed, leaf and stem, along with a base fruit flavor of raspberry/cranberry, and the wine persists into a slightly bitter finish, but it seems to be holding itself back. A second bottle was better, with a little more fruit.",87,27.0
4027,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"With its appealing toast and fruit aromas, this is a rich wine. It does keep plenty of steely texture while allowing the yellow fruits, ripe pear and toast to shine. In style it hovers halfway between the ripe, buttery Meursault of the past and the crisper style of today, a fine compromise and ready to drink now.",90,74.0
4028,Albert Bichot,"Spicy, smoky Lapsang Souchong tea aromas, pure acidity and juicy red plum flavors are all here in this big, but finely structured wine. The tannins are an essential part of the shape of the wine, but act as a support for its richness. The finish brings out the lively acidity of Pinot Noir. Age for five years.",93,
4029,Chanson Père et Fils,"Rich fruit, layered with acidity, stars in a wine that is dense, very much a product of the powerful 2005 vintage. With the concentrated tannins, this is showing that it needs to age, but already the sweet fruits are opulent and soft.",92,65.0
4030,Chanson Père et Fils,"Dense, concentrated, solid, this wine shows the stern side of Nuits-Saint-Georges. The tannins are dry, very firm and rough at the edges. The fruit is just as edgy, with black, juicy plums surrounded by smoky wood and tobacco. The wine needs to age, although it will always have a solid, structured character.",92,125.0
4031,Albert Bichot,"A finely perfumed wine, but one with a tight initial structure. Ripe wild strawberries and mulberries appear with dry tannins and spice from wood. The finish underlines that this is a wine for aging, with its structure and firmness. Keep for 4–5 years.",92,
4032,Albert Bichot,"From parcels in the southern portion of Clos Vougeot, Bichot produces a ripe, relatively soft style of wine. It is, of course, also rich and powerful, but the tannins are sweet, subdued into ripe red plum and raspberry fruits, the acidity giving the wine a fresh, lively character to finish.",92,
4033,Foxen,"What a fine Chardonnay. Made in a bone dry, minerally style, it may not have the immediately seductive quality of some Chards, but it does show a Chablis-like elegance that makes it a natural for food pairing, with its fine citrus and steel tang and mouthwatering acidity.",92,32.0
4034,Testarossa,"Broad aromas of seared lemons, white peach and nectarine are given nuance with a bit of quinine on this entry-level bottling. Stewed lemons and apple-custard flavors show on the plush and pillowy palate, cut with an acidic sizzle.",88,23.0
4035,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"Tangy and mineral, this is a crisp apple- and citrus-driven wine, full of fruitiness while also having a tight texture. Its acidity just adds to the generally ripe character of the wine. Drink now.",87,37.0
4036,Kendall-Jackson,"An okay wine that's light in color and aromatics, traceable in part to its cooler-climate heritage (95% of the grapes were grown in Mendocino, the rest in Sonoma, Monterey and Santa Barbara), which does give it some subtly pleasing red fruit and spice notes. But 2008 was also for much of Mendocino a vintage from hell and this wine may in truth be reflecting that year's challenges.",84,16.0
4037,Louis Latour,"With its tannins, this is initially a firm wine, but then ripe berry fruits emerge, followed by great acidity and freshness.",86,45.0
4038,Georges Duboeuf,"The year 2009 seems to have been a tannic one in Fleurie, producing wines that will benefit from some aging. This fits that bill well, a mineral and austere black fruit flavored wine, with a smoky aftertaste to go with tight acidity.",88,
4039,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"With the largest production in the entire Northwest, it is important that this wine express clean, varietal flavors with characteristic brightness and focus. And it does. Lightly herbal, fresh and clean, its fruit flavors suggest lemongrass, orange and ripe apple. Excellent balance and persistence",88,10.0
4040,Columbia Crest,"This is off dry, low alcohol (11.5%), spiced up with tart acidity and loaded with rich, ripe fruit flavors mixing pears and peaches. Sweet without being sugary, it should appeal to a wide spectrum of wine drinkers, and snap together the flavors of a Thai food. Columbia Crest makes 18,000 cases of this wine.",88,8.0
4041,Louis Latour,"Attractive wine, hinting at the elegance of Chambolle, packed with strawberry-fruit flavors and sweet tannins. There is some final firmness, the acidity mingling with a solid structure.",88,70.0
4042,Louis Latour,"Soft and ripe wine, with gentle tannins and fresh acidity. There is an edge of bitterness that comes between the fruit and the structure.",88,55.0
4043,Williams Selyem,"The east side of the Russian River is home to some of the winery's best vineyards, and this wine exhibits the excellent structure, nerve and ripeness of all of their 2011 Pinots. It's forward but nuanced. Drink now–2017.",91,52.0
4044,Testarossa,"Dry and full in the mouth, this Pinot has a fine weight and structure. It's made from the various vineyards Testarossa buys grapes from, and is virtually as good as the vineyard-designated bottlings, which makes it a value. Shows cherry, cola, tangerine zest and spicy flavors. Good through 2010 or so.",87,37.0
4045,Georges Duboeuf,"A light, crisp, fresh wine, with attractive lemon grass and orange zest flavors. It is juicy, the green fruits full of intensity. There is good minerality as well, underlined by toast from wood aging.",87,25.0
4046,V. Sattui,"Robust in tannins, with crisp, fruity acidity, this Cab has very ripe, jammy blackberry and cherry flavors that have seen their share of smoky oak. It's a good wine but an edgy one. Could develop in the bottle after a couple years.",87,45.0
4047,DFJ Vinhos,"The cool-climate-loving Alvarinho translates well to the coastal Lisboa region. It's rich and creamy, acidity well in hand and supporting the melon and citrus flavors. It's a delicious wine now, but it will age, so keep it until 2015.",88,11.0
4048,Maryhill,"Maple, black fruit and cocoa aromas lead to lighter styled dark-fruit flavors. The barrel influence at times seems a bit heavy, with the flavors not able to stand up to it.",86,40.0
4049,Concha y Toro,"Black cherry, blackberry, olive and gritty oak aromas feed into a scratchy palate with forceful acidity. Oaky, blackened flavors of medicinal berry fruits finish with notes of mint and carob. Overall, this is solid but typically herbal and saucy.",86,11.0
4050,Kunde,"Dark gold in color, this estate-grown wine blends bright, crisp orange, melon and caramel apple flavors with richer toasted oak and vanilla notes.",90,30.0
4051,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"This is firm, in the Pommard style. But because this is a 2015 vintage, the wine is also generously rich and with great red berry fruits. The acidity is in the back of this wine with its bold flavors and concentrated texture. Drink from 2023.",92,103.0
4052,Louis Latour,"Rounded and warm, this wine shows ripe yellow fruits and spice from the wood aging. It's richly endowed, full of toast and with a generous texture. The minerality and acidity are a hint in this rounded wine. Drink from 2020.",92,99.0
4053,Undurraga,"One sniff receives immediate prickle and a hint of fresh bell pepper offset by citrus blossom and passion fruit. All the components of excellent Sauvignon Blanc appear in this carved, sizzling wine: tangerine, orange, grapefruit and lime flavors; freshness and physique; purity and sense of place.",90,20.0
4054,Georges Duboeuf,"One of the smallest crus, Saint-Amour produces firm and structured wines. This Sélection shows both rich black fruit and solid tannins that are typical. Over the next six months, it's likely the fruitiness will become more dominant.",87,
4055,Testarossa,"This is quite a luscious Syrah, soft, smooth, complex and layered, showing qualities of both warm and cool climates. From the cool end of the spectrum comes a lively acidity and not a trace of overripeness. The riper notes of blackberries, cassis, gingersnap cookie and licorice are delicious, enriched by smoky oak. Drink now and for a few years.",92,49.0
4056,Kunde,"It's no small feat they were able to hold this sophisticated wine back so long and still sell it for just over 20 bucks. The wine is soft, dry and rich in red currant, white pepper, licorice and mocha flavors, and has elegant balance.",92,22.0
4057,Testarossa,"A rich style from winemaker Bill Brousseau, this shows smoked pork, plum, boysenberry and dashes of dried ginger on the nose. Rounded black-plum flavors arise on the palate then tighten toward elderberry, brisk cranberry, bay leaf and green peppercorn, altogether savory and tart.",92,64.0
4058,Concha y Toro,"This is a riper, heavier than usual Don Melchor, as evidenced by aromas of raisin along with black plum, coffee and creamy oak. A full, round, plush palate offers more than adequate depth, while black cherry, plum and vanilla flavors come with hints of licorice and chocolate. Hailing from a hot vintage, this avoids almost all herbal characteristics but feels a bit soft and simple. Drink through 2023.",92,120.0
4059,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"CSM's mainstream Cabernet Sauvignon now carries a “100% vinifera rootstock” designation—surely a first for any American winery. It displays more structure than some of the other, similarly priced offerings from the Northwest's largest winery group. With good focus and length, its mix of plum and berry fruit, nicely set in a frame of toast, coffee and charred wood, makes it a surefire, all-purpose, medium-bodied red.",88,14.0
4060,Columbia Crest,"Intensely oaky, buttery and creamy, this lush style also shows ample acidity, keeping the richness in check. It's big and borderline blowsy, but packed with flavor.",88,12.0
4061,Montes,"Ripe aromas of briary blackberry, licorice and baking spices set up a full, chunky mouthfeel. Big black-fruit flavors are slightly minty and herbal, while the finish is earthy and minty, with bright acidity maintaining freshness.",88,13.0
4062,Georges Duboeuf,"In Beaujolais, 2010 was a firm and structured year, and this is very evident in this darkly tannic wine. It is packed with juicy acidity and red berry fruits, while it is also in need of several months' aging.",87,13.0
4063,Georges Duboeuf,"Boasting weight and some richness, the wine shows that the northern Beaujolais crus are the most successful in 2010. The cherry and sweet plum flavors are laced with ripe acidity as well as a mineral edge.",87,15.0
4064,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"This smoky wine is showing its wood, with spice and toasty flavors over the red fruits. The wine will balance out to become open and fruity. Drink from 2019.",90,49.0

4067,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"This new Artist Series red is three-quarters Cabernet Sauvignon, 18% Merlot, and the rest a mix of Cab Franc and Malbec, mostly from the Cold Creek Vineyard. Blue and black fruits are enhanced with barrel flavors of smoke, tobacco and espresso. Some additional years in bottle should help this wine knit together seamlessly.",91,57.0
4068,Foxen,"What a pretty Syrah this is. With moderate alcohol and subtle oak influences, it's dry and stylishly elegant in the mouth. The flavors veer toward ripe cherries and blackberries, sprinkled with cinnamon, cocoa and finely-ground black pepper. Drink now–2015.",91,46.0
4069,Gary Farrell,"The winery brings precision control to Zinfandel, a wine that badly needs some taming but in most cases is allowed to run wild. Here, it has an almost Cabernet-like clarity, with focused tannins and acids and a balance that makes it elegant. But the wild blackberry, blueberry and spice flavors, with a briary, brambly edge of pepper and green stems, are pure Zin.",91,45.0
4070,Testarossa,"Lush in ripe raspberries, cherries and cola, this single-vineyard Pinot Noir is balanced with crisp acidity. It's flamboyant, with plenty of oak influence, yet somehow manages to finish dry and tight. Drink now–2019.",91,60.0

4072,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"The Indian Wells Chardonnay by this producer continues to improve with each vintage. Here, the melding of luscious tropical fruit with buttery barrel flavors is just about perfect. Pineapple, Meyer lemon and candied oranges highlight the intense flavors, and the lushly-applied oak influences carry the full-bodied wine to hold a smooth, satisfying finish.",91,17.0
4073,Wines & Winemakers,"This is a superrich, dense wine. It has firm tannins and a steely, mineral edge that permeates the texture. A ripe black-plum flavor is generous while still young and full of fresh acidity. The wine needs to age, so drink from 2017.",92,22.0
4074,Louis Jadot,"This beautifully balanced wine shows toast that counterpoints the generous yellow fruits and acidity. It's a ripe wine, touched by honey, spice and peach flavors. The aftertaste, with its total freshness, is crisp, lively, mouthfilling and refreshing. Drink from 2018.",94,208.0
4075,Louis Jadot,"Rich and rounded in character, this is already a beautiful wine, from 80-year-old vines. A line of acidity shoots through the wine, giving a long lift to the green fruits and orange zest flavors. It does have weight and a generous texture that reveals itself slowly. Ripe apricots mingle with acidity and toast at the end. Drink from 2019.",94,112.0
4076,Louis Latour,"This wine is rich and soft with acidity rounded out by ripe melon and apple fruit flavors. The background is more structured, tense with apple skins and minerality. Packed with acidity at the end, the wine is crisp, tight and demands aging. Drink from 2019.",94,
4077,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Principally sourced from the Cold Creek Vineyard, this reserve-level Merlot does not quite come up to past vintages. It's balanced and firm, with red and black fruits that currently seem overtaken by the time (22 months) spent in 78% new French oak.",89,50.0
4078,Columbia Crest,"This reserve spent time in 100% new French oak, and shows better-than-average ripeness for this cool vintage. Fruit flavors of berry, cherry and a streak of cassis are at the core, with pleasing aromatics as well. A generous chocolate flavor runs into the finish.",89,45.0
4079,Undurraga,"In this racy, full-bodied wine, olive, spice, chocolate and berry aromas come in front of a flush but acidic palate with a tartaric influence. Herbal red-berry and olive flavors finish long and lasting, with a tomato note.",89,40.0
4080,Maryhill,"Partially fermented on French oak staves, this does express itself with some toasty aromatics, but well-defined and nicely balanced. The fruit offers ripe, mixed flavors of lemon, lime and pineapple, with juicy acidity, no bitterness and impressive length.",89,12.0
4081,Albert Bichot,"Properly opulent, this is a generous, subtly wood-aged wine. Ripe apricot and peach fruits are shot through with crisp apple. The wood and the rich fruits give this structured wine a warm character. It is still young, of course. Drink from 2023.",94,194.0
4082,Foxen,"There's a soft stroke of rosewater to the nose of this single-vineyard bottling as well as raspberry jam, fennel pollen and iron. The palate benefits from strong fennel and white sage, which lifts the berry-fruit and raw-meat flavors. The texture is simultaneously light and penetrating.",94,66.0
4083,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Lacryma Christi is a rustic and savory red wine, with bright tones of dried currant, spice, tobacco and leather. It includes touches of cured meat and bresaola, and the finish is sour and fresh.",85,16.0
4084,Maryhill,"According to its bottle, this has 15.5% alcohol, and yet the raspberry flavor lacks weight and depth. Instead, flavors of stem and earth seem to dominate.",85,17.0
4085,Maryhill,"Not really distinguishable from the winery's regular bottling of Sangiovese, this too has just a hint of sour cherry, with leafy, earthy, drying tannins.",85,20.0
4086,Maryhill,"Chalky and dry, this tastes of barely ripe cherry, with plenty of leafy flavors. The tannins take over quickly in a brief, drying finish.",85,17.0
4087,Wines & Winemakers,"This is a juicy, dense wine from João Silva e Sousa and Francisco Baptista that is packed with dark, steely tannins. A field blend of 10 Douro red varieties, with 12 months of wood aging, it's ripe in sweet, rich red fruits that are balanced by intense acidity. Still young, the wine will be better from 2017.",91,18.0
4088,Testarossa,"Starts off smelling vegetal, although with breathing the cherries come through. In the mouth, turns simple in fruit, with a silky texture. Disappointing.",84,54.0
4089,Wines & Winemakers,"Produced from old vines, this crisp wine is floral and fresh. Concentrated with white and citrus fruit flavors over tight steeliness, it has a serious side of complex textures that will allow it to develop over the next few months. Drink now for the fresh fruit tones, although it will be better from late 2016.",90,20.0
4090,Testarossa,"Luscious golden in color, this dessert wine shows aromas of honeyed and seared lemons, with hints of marigold and toasted sunflower seeds. The palate is rich and sweet, but balanced expertly with a great tartness.",90,25.0
4091,Chanson Père et Fils,"Plenty of wood aromas, but the palate combines the wood notes with smoky acidity, textured green plum and vanilla flavors with a refreshing acidity. There's a tang here: a wine that has bursts of great fruit to go with the wood.",89,55.0
4092,Albert Bichot,"Rich, ripe and fruity, this wine wears its tannins easily. With layers of acidity, red-berry fruit and a dark, dry core, the wine is impressive and set to age. The aftertaste is both sweet with the generous fruit and dry with tannins, finishing firmly. Drink from 2020.",93,90.0
4093,Chanson Père et Fils,"Rich while firm, this wine is structured and dense. It has great fruit potential that is still developing through the tight texture and the concentrated structure. It will be a fine wine, but give it time. Drink from 2020.",93,175.0
4094,Feudi di San Gregorio,"This opens with aromas suggesting pear, yellow stone fruit, Mediterranean herb and a whiff of citrus while the vibrant palate delivers crisp green apple, juicy lime, saline and energizing mineral. Racy acidity provides the backbone. Give this time to fully develop. Drink 2017 through 2024.",93,60.0
4095,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Perfumed with enticing scents of yellow flower, beeswax, orchard fruit and crushed stone, this shows the serious nature of Greco di Tufo. The elegant, mineral-driven palate delivers yellow apple, lemon zest, dried Mediterranean herb and mineral framed in tangy acidity. It's an extremely impressive showing especially given the cool, wet vintage.",93,60.0
4096,V. Sattui,"This Riesling has just the right amount of minerality balanced against apple and peach flavors, and an underlying core of lime.

4101,Foxen,"Winemaker Billy Wathen makes so many single-vineyard wines that he's able to play around with styles, and uses this bottling to explore the lower alcohol side of Pinot Noir. Extremely floral aromas of rose petals, hibiscus and carnation meet with light raspberry on the elegant nose, while the lighter-bodied palate mixes slightly sour red fruit with cedar, thyme and oregano.",91,62.0
4102,Testarossa,"Testarossa blends this wine from grapes sourced from multiple vineyards. It's pretty tasty with a palate that's dry, silky and tart with acidity, along with flavors of cherry, cranberry, mushroom and lush oak. Drink up.",87,27.0
4103,Concha y Toro,"With savory aromas of soy sauce and beef broth, this is not only fruity smelling, it's meaty on the nose. The palate is full and voluminous, but not thick. Flavors of boysenberry and blackberry are slightly leafy and green, while the finish shows a good texture and grabby tannins.",87,11.0
4104,Louis Jadot,"The Clos de la Croix de Pierre forms part of the En Caradeux premier cru, and it creates poised wines. This is the red partner to a white also produced by Louis Jadot, and it displays juicy red fruit, layered with firm tannins. Drinkable now, but also capable of aging for five years.",92,45.0
4105,Siduri,"Although this is silky and elegant, it is one of Siduri's higher alcohol Pinot Noirs. Ripe and impressive, the raspberry and cherry pie flavors are accented by sweet, smoky oak notes. Drink it over the next 2–3 years for sheer pleasure.",92,49.0
4106,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Part of a Limited Release series, this is an all-stainless Chardonnay. Ripe, tart and focused, it offers spicy bursts of yellow and green fruits, and it shows a sur lie-derived texture. The pinpoint details are gorgeous.",91,17.0
4107,Columbia Crest,"A blend of 47% Cabernet Sauvignon, 34% Merlot, 15% Cabernet Franc and 4% Malbec, this is supple and substantial, and it breathes lush notes of plum, cassis, black olive, raw wood and mineral, plus a dash of caramel.",91,30.0
4108,V. Sattui,"This wine comes from a selection of the best concrete egg, oak and stainless-steel-fermented selections of this vineyard-designate, combined with 3% Sémillon.

4110,V. Sattui,"A rustic swagger of leather and earth mark the entry of this wine, a densely packed, thickly tannic expression of tobacco and blackberry pie. It is darkly effected by the 15% addition of Petit Verdot, as well as smaller proportions of Malbec and Syrah.",88,75.0
4111,Maryhill,"Toffee, exotic spice, vanilla, raspberry and cranberry aromas are backed by full-bodied fruit and barrel flavors. There's a lot of fruit in the bottle but the oak seems to get in the way.",88,42.0

4116,Iron Horse,"The second vintage of this specific block, Home is spicy in notes of orange oil and peel, with a hint of rose water. Soft, integrated tannins and a touch of graham cracker play off of juicy blackberry and plum flavors, finishing with glimmers of black and red licorice.",93,85.0
4117,Iron Horse,"This is the producer's highest and most westerly vineyard site. It holds back from the start, still tightly wound and somewhat reduced on the nose. As it opens, ethereal layers of wild strawberry, green tea and lacings of herb and white pepper unveil to tremendous effect.",93,85.0

4129,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Syrahs are plentiful in Washington, but not in such quantities. Inevitably, some of the nuances of site and vintage have been smoothed over. What remains is a textbook version of the grape as it shows across the varied Columbia Valley. Smooth and supple, its satiny mix of blueberry and vanilla cream offer a fine introduction to the style. The tannins have grip and a hint of green tea flavor.",87,14.0
4130,Concha y Toro,"Light, classic aromas of gooseberry, lime and nettle are good indicators of what's to follow. That would be a high-acid, racy, seemingly early picked wine with flavors of lemon, Granny Smith apple and gooseberry. A lasting, tangy, acidic finish is crackling as a lightning bolt.",87,23.0
4131,Albert Bichot,"This young, textured wine shows a mix of strong minerality and ripe white fruits. The Albert Bichot Chablis domaine has a fine parcel from this premier cru. Refreshing citrus and tight acidity contrast with the warmer vanilla and yellow fruits. Drink from 2021.",93,45.0

4141,Siduri,"This is a stellar representation of the region, combining ripeness with dark earth and wild herb notes. Aromas of black cherry, crushed slate, turned loam, dried hibiscus and violets make for a lavish nose. The rounded palate weaves black raspberry together with gravel, thyme and sagebrush. Iron fist, silk glove, utterly delicious.",96,60.0

Drink from 2023.",95,154.0
4147,Wines & Winemakers,"With its arm-breaking, heavy bottle, this is a wine obviously meant to impress. Old vines do give concentration, and heavy tannins promise aging.

4148,Chehalem,"Bursting with fresh, bright scents and flavors of strawberries, raspberries and huckleberries, this juicy, polished and powerful wine is spring in a bottle. Lush and lively acids underscore the fruit and lead into a long, spicy finish.",90,24.0
4149,Williams Selyem,"This is huge in fruit, like Godzilla trampling skyscrapers underfoot. Yet it's so exquisitely balanced in all its parts, it possesses a Zen-like stillness at the center of all these massive, swirling elements. This is easily Williams Selyem's best Papera Zin yet. So rich in black raspberry jam, red currant, mocha, pepper and sweet sandalwood flavors, yet so focused, it just blows your mind.",95,52.0
4150,Lynmar,"Everything about this wine screams for aging. It's tight in acids and tannins, and the fruitiness tastes young and jammy with waves of raspberries, cherries, red currants and mocha. By turns, it's sweet and bitter, but always succulent, and with a finish so long and spicy, it persists after a full minute. Cellar until 2017, and it should provide beautiful drinking for many more years.",95,70.0
4151,Chanson Père et Fils,"This powerful wine has considerable structure and considerable acidity that will shine as the wine develops. The fruit is delicious, showing great potential. Drink from 2020.",92,127.0
4152,Testarossa,"Lots of ripe raspberry, cherry, cola and sandalwood flavors in this Pinot Noir. It has elegant, silky texture, with bright acidity, but you do want to drink it now before the fruit fades away.",87,23.0
4153,Gary Farrell,"With brisk acidity and upfront fruit, this is ready to drink. The pineapple, pear and oak flavors are housed in a creamy mouthfeel.",87,32.0
4154,Casa Santos Lima,"The name, Al-Ria, at the seaside, is a reflection of the importance of the beach culture to this region. The wine has a cool, minty character although its black fruits are ripe and full. It is rich with berry flavors, warm tannins and a dry firm aftertaste. Drink now although the wine will soften.",88,15.0
4155,Wines & Winemakers,"Ripe and bold, this is a rich wine whose dense fruit is balanced by its equally dense tannins. It has spice, juicy black fruits and a structure that emphasizes minerality and oak aging. It's not quite ready, so drink from 2017.",88,18.0
4156,Lynmar,"Another knockout of this vintage from this site, a portion within the larger estate Quail Hill Vineyard, Summit is perfumed and pretty, full bodied without ever seeming heavy. Crisp punches of strawberry, cherry and a streak of lemon tartness please the palate in an endless loop of complex, velvety texture.",95,80.0
4157,Bründlmayer,"Very ripe notions of red-cheeked mirabelle plums and sun-ripened apricots with an edge of nettle shimmer on the nose. The palate is a clearly delineated but gorgeous canvas for foliage-fringed citrus—mandarin, clementine and tangerine all vie for space while yuzu adds spice and savor. There is generosity and slenderness. The finish is ultra clean and the entire wine is surprisingly approachable. Drink this now and rejoice, or keep it and look forward: In either case, this is a delicious fruity trinket of pure pleasure. Drink 2017–2040.",95,75.0
4158,Louis Jadot,"A hugely rich, powerful Chardonnay, layering ripe fruit with a core of tannic structure, acidity, wood and huge depth of flavor. The wine is concentrated, with layers of fruit and textured acidity. Of course, it needs aging—7 years at least.",96,130.0
4159,Undurraga,"This Leyda SB opens with textbook cool-climate aromas of snap pea, passion fruit and lime. A tangy pointy acidic palate deals the usual Leyda flavor suspects: citrus, bell pepper and jalapeño. This is consistent on the finish, but short.",89,22.0
4160,Gary Farrell,"Ripe enough in raspberry, cherry and mulberry fruit, with some flashy notes, but it's all sweet, upfront flavor, with not much else going on. The acidity is fine and the tannins are pretty, but this ultimately is a fairly simple, jammy wine.",85,55.0
4161,Santa Ema,"Chunky and earthy on the nose, which is big but undistinguished. The palate is tight and high in acid, while the flavors of wood, mint and roasted berry fruits come with pepper and herbal accents. Dry and basic on the finish.",85,12.0
4162,Louis Latour,"A bright, toasty wine, with the ripe fruits of the vintage and characteristics from the wood giving extra richness to this finely structured, mineral-textured wine.",90,70.0
4163,Chanson Père et Fils,"This is dark and wood laden, with sweet, rich fruit and a firm, dense structure. It has a full feel, and its opulence is likely to develop over the next 2–3 years.",93,107.0
4164,Chanson Père et Fils,"This is crisp, with citrus and red apple fruits that are heightened by the taut structure. Nervy acidity adds to the tense feel while judicious layers of wood warm the finish. For long-term aging.",93,94.0
4165,Foxen,"This is classic Santa Maria Valley Pinot Noir, with its dark color, full body, ripe berry and currant flavors and, especially, the array of exotic crushed brown spices. New French oak brings lots of smoky, buttery, toasty richness. Great to drink now with tuna, salmon, lamb and beef dishes.",93,58.0
4166,Robert Mondavi,"Mondavi's best Pinot Noir in many years, this shows the chilliness of the vintage in its acidity and leanness, but it's a vital, beautiful austerity, like a fighter in training with zero body fat. At the same time, it proves to be flashy and elegant, with rich flavors of cherry and red currant. Drink it over the next six years.",93,60.0
4167,Williams Selyem,"Raspberries, cherries, cola, exotic spices and sweet cedar mark the flavors of this Pinot Noir. It's elegant in the mouth, with brisk acidity, but also a distinct earthiness. The combination gives the wine a yin-yang of weight and weightlessness. It's too young to properly enjoy now, so drink from 2019 and beyond.",92,59.0
4168,Williams Selyem,"A highly drinkable and enjoyable wine unfettered by wood, this shows pretty floral notes of honeysuckle and apple blossom that develop in a light-bodied frame of restraint. Pear and salt rise on the lengthy finish.",91,39.0
4169,Columbia Crest,"The aromas in this wine pop, with notes of dried herb, plum, vanilla and smoked meat. It brings a compelling sense of texture, coating the palate from end to end with exquisitely balanced fruit and savory flavors. It's a knockout at this price.",91,12.0
4170,Columbia Crest,"Aromas of toast, char, and milk chocolate along with blue and black fruit are followed by velvety soft fruit flavors. It shows an appealing sense of balance and polish.",89,15.0
4171,Wines & Winemakers,"This is a rustic, barnyard-scented wine, with tannins and acidity but lacking fruit. Think of it as one to quaff without too much thought.",83,11.0
4172,Williams Selyem,"Pretty as all get-out, this wine is a floral masterpiece—a study in coastal rose and forest scents with a counterpunch of white pepper that leaves one wanting more. Juicy raspberry, strawberry and tangerine flavors are seasoned in allspice and tobacco, the palate so beautifully delicate yet fully realized in savory complexity and length.",98,75.0
4173,Kunde,"From the producer's family estate, this reserve white is golden in color and appropriately rich in crème brûlée and butterscotch, yet balanced and firm. Creamy, it offers flavors and aromas of lush melon and orange, finishing with sumptuous vanilla.",90,40.0
4174,Columbia Crest,"This wine is 57% Syrah, 25% Cabernet Sauvignon, 9% Viognier, 6% Merlot and 3% other varieties. The Viognier gives the aromas and deftly styled flavors, with notes of orange peel and flowers. The Syrah lends blueberries and gaminess, with herb and chocolate notes coming from Cabernet.",88,12.0
4175,Williams Selyem,"Another massive, dramatically rich Chardonnay from Williams Selyem. Purists will find it ponderous, but there's no denying the wealth of pineapple tart, orange custard, crème brûlée, butterscotch and vanilla flavors. Lobster comes to mind as a natural partner.",92,60.0
4176,DFJ Vinhos,"This is a very Douro blend for this wine from Lisboa region. It brings structure and minerality to fill out the dark-black fruits. With ripe tannins and bright acidity balancing the fruit, it is ready to drink.",88,13.0
4177,DFJ Vinhos,"Full-bodied, soft wine, with pleasant, open flavors of melon, lime and ripe white figs. There is sweetness, emphasizing the softness of the wine. Pleasant and drinkable now.",84,13.0
4178,DFJ Vinhos,"A fresh, bone-dry rosé, packed with acidity, red currants and a touch of caramel. The wine is light, summery, good for apéritif or food.",84,13.0
4179,DFJ Vinhos,"Soft and creamily fruity, this is an attractive, fresh wine. It has citrus fruit and apple-skin flavors and crisp, clean acidity. For drinking over the next year.",85,7.0
4180,V. Sattui,"A Grenache-driven blend with 28% Syrah and 9% Mourvèdre, this is a substantial, concentrated wine generous in leather, pipe tobacco and blackberry pie, accented teasingly in clove. With a big, meaty presence and long, grippy finish, it should stand the test of cellaring, through 2020.",90,36.0
4181,Santa Ema,"Clean yet dilute on the bouquet, with touches of lime and grassiness. The palate, however, is kind of heavy and honeyed, a direct reflection of its warm Maipo roots. Tastes sweet and creamy but without much zesty fruit. Maybe a little too soft and candied, but still pretty good.",85,10.0
4182,Undurraga,"The first Pinot in Undurraga's Terroir Hunter series is lean, tart and zesty, but also clean and pleasing in its own right. Tea and dried cherry aromas yield to a spunky, lean palate of sharp raspberry and orange peel flavors. Finishes light but clean, with tartness.",85,25.0
4183,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"Tangy and mineral, this is a crisp apple- and citrus-driven wine, full of fruitiness while also having a tight texture. Its acidity just adds to the generally ripe character of the wine. Drink now.",87,37.0
4184,Gary Farrell,"A tasty Sauvignon Blanc, with crisply acidic grapefruit, pineapple and lime juice flavors, touched with oak. A nice appetizer sipper, with some complexity. Good with asparagus risotto, bruschetta with goat cheese, a nice roast chicken with sautéed new potatoes and rosemary.",88,25.0
4185,Testarossa,"Unique aromas of lime blossoms, flowering herbs and a tiny bit of jalapeño combine for a fascinating nose on this winery's entry-level offering. There is a slightly bell pepper element on the palate, but it's quite tasty alongside the ripe pears and other familiar flavors.",89,20.0
4186,Iron Horse,"Lots of crisp, citrusy acidity in this wine, which brightens the pineapple, orange, lemon and lime flavors. Meanwhile, 100% new oak adds a rich coating of smoky, buttered toast. The wine is dramatic, rather than subtle, and is at its best now.",91,46.0
4187,Casa Santos Lima,"This is a soft, bold and rounded wine. Rich black currant and berry fruits dominate the blend of mainly Portuguese grapes, with a touch of Syrah. The wine is balanced, ripe and full in the mouth. Drink now.",86,
4188,Casa Santos Lima,"This wood-aged wine has a ripe fruitiness about it. The tannins give some structure while not taking away from the generous blackberry fruits. It's rich and warm, just hinting at pepper on the finish. Drink now.",86,
4189,Wines & Winemakers,"The earthy aromas of Castelão show strongly. Complex, rich and juicy, this wine's tannins and black fruits vie amicably for dominance, and they promise good aging. It has a spice note and a firm structure, with a fleshy character.",91,15.0
4190,Siduri,"The raspberry and cherry flavors are a bit obvious at first, but then the balanced tannins and acids become apparent, and the tasteful application of sweet, smoky oak surfaces. This wine grows more interesting as it sits in the glass. Drink it now and over the next 3–4 years for maximum freshness.",91,55.0
4191,Williams Selyem,"One of the lighter-bodied wines from the producer and the first to designate this Westside Road vineyard, this wine shows expansive strawberry, raspberry and blueberry flavors, with a hearty texture, moderate acidity moderate and almost creamy finish.",90,59.0
4192,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,The wine comes from a new appellation at the southern end of the Côte de Beaune. It is a blend of different premier cru vineyards to give a juicy raspberry flavored. Tannins show a solid dry background to the attractive perfumed fruitiness. Drink from 2019.,89,
4193,Louis Jadot,"This is a round, rich and soft style of Chardonnay. It feels generous, and its yellow fruit flavor pushes through the acidity. It slowly opens to reveal complex tropical-fruit notes, and it will develop further, so give it another four years.",92,75.0
4194,Louis Jadot,"With grapes from long contracted growers, this wine represents the structure as well as the ripe fruit of the appellation. It imparts a smoky character from wood aging as well as a tense layer of tannins that give it a dry edge. Drink from 2021.",91,67.0
4195,Williams Selyem,"Forest, mint and campfire scents are complemented by brambly black cherry in this explosively complex wine. Soft and subtle, it has juicy layers of cranberry, orange and maraschino, with a roundness and firmness to the strong tannin. The finish is all about coffee, cardamom and five spice.",93,82.0
4196,Chehalem,"Pungent and assertively herbal, this blend of Chehalem's three estate vineyards has aromatics to spare, along with an earthy mix of root, stem and brambly fruit. There's a streak of cola also, and it delivers plenty of power for a cool vintage wine that clocks in at 12.7% alcohol.",89,29.0
4197,Columbia Crest,"Merlot and Syrah make up the bulk of this wine, with the remainder pinches of Viognier and Cabernet Franc. Fresh flower, plum and milk chocolate aromas are followed by appealing sweet fruit and barrel flavors.",87,15.0
4198,Columbia Crest,"Vanilla, toast and stone-fruit aromas are followed by light, elegantly styled flavors that show persistence. It comes off as a bit faint but what's there is pleasing.",87,15.0
4199,Siduri,"Like a fresh-picked cherry off the tree, the aromatic entry into this appellation wine is compelling and memorable in Proustian ways. Medium bodied, it's a highly quaffable experience, sultry on the palate while maintaining bright of acidity that ping-pongs between lush and lean.",92,32.0
4200,Columbia Crest,"A mild, softly fruity wine, with unusual grace notes of sandalwood and incense. The fruit suggests cinnamon-sprinkled pears, and the acidity has been cut and softened. A little bit of a plastic, Band-Aid flavor infuses the finish.",83,8.0
4201,Chanson Père et Fils,"The first mouthful reveals a wine that is just plain opulent and rich. Only on the second taste do dense tannins push their way in, a structure that is concentrated, dry and tight. The fruit flavors are also forward, strawberry juice touched with cranberry juice dryness. This could age well, give it 4–5 years.",92,65.0
4202,Chanson Père et Fils,"Solid and concentrated, this wine initially is tight, showing minerality as well as rich fruit. The dark tannins then open to reveal sweetness, ripe strawberry jelly as well as soft acidity and licorice. A big wine that will evolve over the next several years.",92,95.0
4203,Iron Horse,"The Wedding Cuvée is one of Iron Horse's sweeter bubblies, but it's not a sweet wine. It's soft, creamy and delicious. Brimming with flavors of green apples, strawberries, brioche and pepper, it continues the winery's brilliant tradition of crafting some of the finest sparkling wines in California.",92,38.0
4204,Louis Jadot,"Raspberries with hints of cranberry dominate this juicy but structured wine. This is a wine that shows a very elegant style, certainly not forceful, but deliciously direct.",91,59.0
4205,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Taurasi is one of the great red wines of Italy (sometimes dubbed “the Barolo of the South”), and this expression delivers amazing intensity both in terms of its bouquet and mouthfeel. Its aromas include ripe, chewy blackberry, pipe tobacco, toasted espresso and crushed granite. The mouthfeel is plush, rich and firmly textured, with polished tannins and a smoky aftertaste.",90,38.0
4206,V. Sattui,"V. Sattui has been making some pretty good Cabernets, and here's another one. It's classic Napa, with smooth, polished tannins, fine acidity and ripe, full-bodied flavors of blackberries, black currants and cedar. Might even develop additional bottle complexity over the next 6–8 years.",90,35.0
4207,Louis Latour,"This wine has structure, typical of this appellation, as well as dark black fruits and rich tannins. Acidity cuts through this ripeness, bringing in freshness. Spice and an attractive perfume come along at the end. Drink from 2019.",90,80.0
4208,Louis Latour,"Tense and structured, this is a firm, concentrated wine from the top vineyard in the appellation. It has tight acidity as well as red-currant flavors. The structure is still firm and condensed, and the wine will need time. It has potential; drink from 2019.",90,65.0
4209,Santa Ema,"Pear and apple aromas open this unoaked Chardonnay. In the mouth, there's not a lot going on except for acidity, and the flavors are mostly neutral save for some tropical fruit. A lively feeling finish closes out what amounts to a fresh but basic wine.",85,10.0
4210,Wines & Winemakers,"A fizzy, bubbly wine that is off-dry, very refreshing and fragrant. Soft flavors of apple, grape and even a touch of honey make this a wine that will slip down easy, especially as an apéritif.",85,9.0
4211,DFJ Vinhos,"A light and soft wine, this is fruity, with gentle acidity. Apples and lemon juice flavors complement each other to give a bright and fresh aftertaste. Screwcap.",84,9.0
4212,Iron Horse,"For those who like their sparkling wines a little sweet. This Pinot Noir-Chardonnay blend has the highest dose of residual sugar of all Iron Horse's bubblies, and it shows in the jellied flavors of raspberries, strawberries and limes. Very crisp acidity provides needed balance and elegance.",88,31.0
4213,Foxen,"Fresh and tart in acidity, this is a clean, savory evocation of a variety that few Californians manage to produce this well. It's rich in apple, citrus, peach and floral flavors, with a lychee, spicy complexity that makes it a natural for Asian fare.",88,20.0
4214,Concha y Toro,"Pure, alluring aromas of minerally black fruits, lavender, cola, fir tree and pepper combine to form a highly inviting bouquet. This doesn't fall off in the mouth, where it's more fresh and bouncy than heavy. Flavors of dark berry fruits, herbs and chocolate end in a rich, grabby, textured finish. Drink this lusty but elegant Syrah now through 2016.",90,22.0
4215,Williams Selyem,"There's a fresh, lilting quality to this Pinot, a silky airiness that feels weightless on the palate. Doubtless that's due to the moderate alcohol. But there's nothing light about the flavors, which are complex in black raspberry pie, softened Dr. Pepper cola, butterscotch, toast and spices. A beautiful Russian River Pinot made for drinking now with upscale fare.",90,49.0
4216,Williams Selyem,"Smooth, rich, round and packed with lush black cherry, raspberry, cedar, spice and cinnamon flavors. The tannins are silky, and the acidity is firm and bright. Slightly warm at the end.",92,64.0
4217,Concha y Toro,"Berry aromas are followed by a round, wholesomeness that can't be criticized. The palate is unlike many a Carmenère because it eschews the herbal, green element that's inherent to the grape, and instead offers plum, blackberry and all the richness one can conjure. A round, finish of light oak and vanilla seals it all in fine fashion. Surely the most jammy, expressive and pure Carmenère that Chile has to offer.",91,29.0
4218,Concha y Toro,"At first the nose is like caramelized popcorn, a forward combination of oak and toast. The flavors are of apple, pear and citrus, and that well-blended package is carried by excellent acidity, the type you could call “bracing.” The finish goes on for quite some time, proof that this is a ripe, healthy wine that's hitting its stride.",91,25.0
4219,Williams Selyem,"Quite spicy, with cinnamon and peppery cherry, raspberry, black currant, anise, tea and plum notes. Smooth, silky tannins frame it all, with a mellow finish. Quite nice. Editors' Choice.",91,27.0
4220,Siduri,"Clearly from a cool climate, dominated by tomato, mushroom and herb flavors just breaking into black cherry. Dry, with great acidity and complex tannins. This is a subtle Pinot that will appeal to tasters who enjoy thinking about what's in their mouth. Editors' Choice.",91,28.0
4221,Williams Selyem,"Quite ripe but a bit chewy on the palate. Pretty cherry, strawberry, tea, spice and herb flavors are at the core. Tannins are slightly robust, but still ripe. The wine finishes long, clean and elegant.",90,32.0
4222,DFJ Vinhos,"A very soft, open style of wine. It has ripe white pear and spice flavors, but everything is muted. It is clean, fresh, with some lemon flavors just creeping in finally.",83,9.0
4223,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"Based in Nuits Saint-Georges, Aegerter has its own domaine around the town. This wine, with its new wood and spice flavors, is balanced with red-berry fruits and soft tannins. It will develop well and should be ready to drink from 2019.",90,80.0
4224,Casa Santos Lima,"From a small sub-region of Lisboa, this stylish, structured wine is firm and tannic. It has plenty of ripe berry fruit to balance the tannins as well as acidity that cuts through the richness of the wine. It is ready to drink.",90,11.0
4225,Louis Latour,"Vines situated in the heart of the village give this wine its ripe, generous berry flavor. The tannins, while firm, are integrated into the bold fruitiness. This round while structured wine has good acidity to balance the richness. Drink from 2019.",90,80.0
4226,Louis Latour,"This wine is structured and firm, with some bitterness. Acidity and red-currant fruits bring out the freshness of the year while still needing time to develop. The wine is concentrated and tight at the end. It will take time to be ready, so don't drink before 2022.",90,105.0
4227,Columbia Crest,Vanilla and cookie dough flavors dominate. The fruit is light and simple cherry candy; the tannins are equally light. Quaffable and refreshing.,86,15.0

4229,Santa Ema,"Tarry black-cherry aromas are a bit damp, oaky and scratchy, but overall this opens well. A solid, firm, edgy palate offers flavors of herbal blackberry and baked black plum, while the finish is meaty and a touch salty.",86,10.0
4230,Columbia Crest,"The oak (40% new French and American) is up front, with aromas of barrel spices, cocoa and generous amounts of vanilla followed by cherries and blue fruit. This wine is velvety in feel, displaying a mixture of fruit and barrel that carries through the finish. The oak influence is heavy but the appeal is impossible to ignore.",90,15.0
4231,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"This wine is immediate in its appeal with aromas of lime leaf, flowers and peach. It drinks off dry with a zing of acidity that beautifully frames the full-fruit flavors.",89,9.0
4232,Columbia Crest,"There's plenty of nuance and detail on this concrete-aged wine, with its baked apple and spice aromas and flavors. It shows a fine sense of elegance and balance.",89,24.0
4233,Louis Jadot,"Already beautiful, this comes from an estate that's managed by Louis Jadot in Puligny-Montrachet, always producing fine wines. It's smooth and toasty, although it is already showing ripe yellow fruits and fragrant acidity. Although drinkable now, it really needs to age, so keep until 2018.",94,125.0
4234,Lynmar,"This fresh, supple Pinot comes from a cool Russian River Valley site overlapping the Sonoma Coast AVA. Jenkins sits above the fog line and is rich in Goldridge soils. The wine is lightly mushroomy in earth, and a keen streak of exotic spiciness kicks in convincingly on the finish, after intense and complicated layers of red cherry, raspberry and lavender.",94,70.0
4235,Louis Latour,"This wine is ripe, full of yellow fruits and soft acidity. It's creamy and ripe, but cut with orange zest and a mineral texture. It will be ready to drink from 2017.",90,90.0
4236,DFJ Vinhos,"This is a cool, light wine. It has stalky black fruits and tannins that come from the fruit skins. It is a wine to drink almost as an apéritif: light and fruity at the end.",84,7.0
4237,DFJ Vinhos,"This is a lively, fruity wine that is great as an apéritif. With yellow fruits that are cut with acidity, it is a fresh, bright wine that is ready to drink now.",84,8.0
4238,Santa Ema,"The aromas of apricot, flowers and beeswax are like a welcome mat. The mouth is full and properly acidic; flavors of honey, ripe white fruits and some mustard seed make for a wine that's got a lot of power working for it. Best Buy.",86,8.0
4239,Montes,"Spicy and woody, with a pungency on the nose. The round palate is full of red-berry fruit and a fair amount of supporting oak. That wood is confirmed on the finish, where things turn a bit buttery and rich. Fortunately some lively tannins and cleansing acids keep things from getting bogged down. A good everyday Cab. Best Buy.",86,10.0
4240,Testarossa,"A three-county blend of cool coastal climate Pinots. Shows pretty flavors of cherries and raspberries and peppery spices, in a light, silky package with firm acidity.",85,32.0
4241,Lynmar,"A medium-bodied vineyard designate, this wine opens in heady aromas of caramel pretzel and sea spray before unleashing a thick concentration of toasted oak and richness. Tangy citrusy lemon pith and wet stone provide a counterpoint that balances the fullness.",93,60.0
4242,Wines & Winemakers,"From a vineyard situated in a forested area of northern Tejo comes this is a structured version of Merlot. It is ripe and rich with black fruits, as well as dark tannins and firm concentration. It could benefit from further aging, so drink from 2018.",93,30.0
4243,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"Gentle, aromatic notes of ripe apricot appear first, followed by a little smoke. The palate comes in like a clarion call of lemony, brisk, citric freshness. This wine is streamlined and crystal clear, with a defined outline and a stony, concentrated core. With all its power it is muscular but suave and ultraclean.",93,55.0
4244,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"Hints of flinty smoke precede notes of ripe pear fruit on the nose. The palate comes with an unusually light-footed, almost fleeting transparency. Instead of weight there is depth and promise with a citrus-scented core that wants to be plumbed and explored. There are hints of almond and gingerbread spice that frame this lovely, slender, dry and spicy Pinot Gris with its clean finish.",93,60.0
4245,DFJ Vinhos,"Full and ripe, this is a lemon and crisp apple flavored wine. There is a hint of toast from the six months in barrel that also adds a little pepper. Fine acidity and a tangy texture suggests it could age. Drink this wine from 2017.",89,13.0
4246,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"The characteristic 2014 acidity makes a lovely lemony splash in the center of this dry, refreshing wine. Lemon freshness rises from the glass, offering lots of verve and a lip-smacking finish.",89,26.0

4248,DFJ Vinhos,"A dark, brooding style of tannic Douro wine. It is lean initially, with a strong mineral character and firm black plum-skin flavors plus leather and tight acidity. When it opens out, this becomes a great value from the Douro.",88,10.0
4249,DFJ Vinhos,"Pinot Noir and Portugal don't normally go together, but DFJ seem to have made a specialty of growing this variety in the cooler Estremadura region. This has more Portuguese than Burgundian character, with its spice, juicy red berry and dried fruits, finishing with blackberry and acidity.",88,16.0
4250,Siduri,"An absolutely first-rate Pinot Noir that's perfect for drinking now and over the next year or so. The texture is light and elegant, almost weightless, yet the raspberry, cherry, red licorice, cola and spice flavors pack a whallop.",88,29.0
4251,Maryhill,"Dark, smoky and herbal, this wine, the second Malbec from Maryhill, does capture some of that grape's lovely character. Tart wild berry fruit is cut with sharp acids, and laced with herb and hints of stone. There is a bit of saddle leather showing through the tannins, but not so much as to wipe out the sweet fruit. A persistent finish tastes like fresh picked raspberries.",88,40.0
4252,Chanson Père et Fils,"Once the sulfur aromas from recent bottling blow over, the wine shows ripe fruit with a soft texture. Pear and yellow fruits are going to come through in a few months. Drink from 2015.",86,

4255,Feudi di San Gregorio,"New leather, truffle, dark spice and black plum aromas take shape in the glass along with a whisper of violet. The firmly structured elegant palate delivers blackberry, wild cherry, licorice and tobacco against a backbone of youthfully austere fine-grained tannins and bright acidity. It's still tightly wound so give it time to fully open and develop. Drink 2022–2032.",93,70.0
4256,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,A soft and fruity wine that brings out attractive red berries and ripe plum flavors. There is the lightest touch of structure in a wine that is totally ready to drink.,85,17.0
4257,Williams Selyem,"This bottling offers an expression of velvety plush texture that's persistent in stony minerality and an edge of graphite. Cranberry, rhubarb and orange provide tart, tangy fruit flavors that are irresistible around the complex spice core.",92,39.0
4258,Testarossa,"Pomegranate and cranberry aromas gain complexity from wet slate and wild-thyme touches. The palate blends tangy fruit with earthy herbs, showing sage, dill, Earl Gray tea and fennel against a dried berry backdrop.",90,64.0
4259,Montes,"On first take, this smells high-toned and much like pine and sweat. With time, out come flavors of baking spices, vanilla, lychee, apricot and honeydew melon. On the finish, this is fresh, with flavors of vanilla and botrytis. Drink now.",90,16.0
4260,Trapiche,"This blend of coastal and desert grapes smells and tastes tropical, with floral notes and a preponderance of citrus character. There isn't too much variation to the flavor profile, which is centered on white citrus fruits.",88,20.0
4261,Maryhill,"This wine is mostly Syrah (47%), with the rest near equal parts Mourvèdre and Grenache. The aromas offer notes of cranberry and cherry, while the palate provides plump yet elegant fruit flavors, with barrel spices extending on the finish.",88,44.0
4262,Undurraga,"Cool, crisp aromas of celery, bell pepper and sea brine introduce a citrusy palate with refreshing acidity. Tangerine, grapefruit and cactus flavors finish tangy, lemony and alert.",88,14.0
4263,Kendall-Jackson,"There's a mellow, honeyed richness to this Chardonnay, with apricot, orange, mango and vanilla flavors making it especially tasty. It's a flamboyant, complex wine at a great price, and easy to find, with 84,000 cases produced.",90,15.0
4264,Lynmar,"In terms of opulence and complexity, this is the least of Lynmar's 2011 Pinot Noirs. But it's all relative, because this is a fantastic wine. Its hallmarks are dryness, moderate alcohol, tart acidity and a silky texture. The sour-cherry candy and persimmon flavors have a mushroomy edge that suggests wild mushroom risotto.",90,45.0
4265,Louis Latour,"This dense wine has a strong sense of dry tannins as well as red-berry acidity. It is balanced, in keeping with the cherry and strawberry fruits. The acidity, cutting through, keeps the wine bright and fruity. The end is strawberry jam with attractive acidity. Drink from 2018.",91,90.0
4266,Iron Horse,"Made from 70% Pinot Noir and 30% Chardonnay, then aged three years, this wine offers a copper-pink color followed by dry, firm acidity and highlights of cherry, cassis and grapefruit zest. A gentle nudge of nutmeg closes in on the finish, giving the wine a salty air and complex ending.",91,44.0
4267,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"A return to pure, single vineyard Sauvignon Blanc. With alcohol at 12.5% this dry wine is quite European in style. Elegant, lively and fresh, with a cool mix of cucumber, melon and green apple fruit flavors.",88,15.0
4268,Williams Selyem,"A zippy blend of bright lemon and herb flavors that presage a powerful mix of Mandarin orange, grapefruit, peach, melon, spice, clove, apricot and honeyed notes. Ultralong on the finish",93,32.0
4269,Siduri,"From some of this appellation's best vineyards, an interesting wine that captures your imagination. Has broad flavors of cherry, earth, sautéed mushroom, cola and toast, and is very dry. Uplifting acids and soft but complex tannins make for terrific structure. A winery to watch. Editors' Choice.",92,34.0
4270,Georges Duboeuf,"With intense acidity, this is a firm and tannic wine, unusual for a Brouilly. The tannins give the wine weight, an almost severe feel, the acidity cutting right through the juicy berry fruits.",85,15.0
4271,Georges Duboeuf,"With a very mineral texture, this is a wine with as much tannin as fruit. It does have a bitter cherry character that gives some freshness, while the aftertaste combines both the dryness and the acidity.",85,13.0
4272,Bründlmayer,"Initially closed, this opens up slowly into a very bundled, concentrated yet fluid stream of citrus flesh and zest. There are overtones of kitchen herbs like chervil but lemony freshness trumps. There is a lightness of touch, a wonderful, lithe elegance and a lasting finish.",93,25.0
4273,Bründlmayer,"Perfumed with floral, citric freshness this evokes jasmine blossom and cut grapefruit peel. The palate is of an exquisite lightness and a slight spritz adds extra zip to the already electric little number. Just one sip of this ultrapure, racy wine and you are thoroughly refreshed. This is a Riesling that spells summer.",93,40.0
4274,DFJ Vinhos,"A blend of northern and southern Portuguese grapes, this is a seriously firm wine that's structured and dense. Spiced black plums are layered with big, drying tannins and acidity, which promise long aging for this impressive wine. Drink from 2017.",92,20.0
4275,Gary Farrell,"Awesomely rich and buttery, with new French oak showing up as toast, and the intensely concentrated fruit of the vineyard starring in the form of pineapple and papaya jam. Bright acidity makes the richness shine, while moderate alcohol, officially 14.1% by volume, keeps everything light and transparent. Drink now–2016, before the fruit fades.",92,50.0
4276,Testarossa,"An abundance of everything marks this best-barrel selection, which always is the winery's most expensive Chardonnay. The richness of the tropical fruit and apricot flavors is obvious. So is the oak. The result is as opulent a Chardonnay as California is capable of producing, but one that, awesome as it is, nonetheless lacks the interest of Testarossa's single-vineyard Chardonnays.",92,59.0
4277,Testarossa,"What a delicious Pinot Noir. The cool, long vintage has given it wonderful lightness and acidity, yet also an intensity of fruit that makes it irresistible. Marked by flavors of raspberries, cherries, cola and red currants, it's a wine to savor now, with Pinot-friendly foods such as lamb and steak.",92,59.0
4278,Testarossa,"The winery brings a Pinot Noir-esque touch to this Syrah, with its silky-heavy texture and cherry, cola and white pepper flavors. The tannins give it away, lending weight and substance, but still, it's amazingly supple for Syrah this powerful. Drink now–2016.",92,54.0
4279,Testarossa,"Has to be one of the most forward, immediately drinkable Pisoni Pinots out there. It's enormously flattering in raspberries, cherries, currants and cola, with sweet toasty oak complexities. The acidity is gorgeous, the tannins soft. There's no reason to age this beautiful wine, so drink it now and through 2016.",92,67.0
4280,Testarossa,"Light and easy on the nose with hibiscus, cranberry and pomegranate notes, this bottling from a famous vineyard also picks up some crushed slate aromas as well. Compared to the many rich bottlings from this region, this is rather reserved on the sip, with tart cranberry, peppery spice and black tea flavors.",90,67.0
4281,Concha y Toro,"Aromas of balsam wood, sandalwood-scented soap, blackberry and rubber feed into a drawing palate with abrasive tannins. A heavy oak character leads blackberry and licorice flavors, while this feels tannic and grabby on the finish, with acidity that sticks out. Drink through 2023.",90,24.0
4282,DFJ Vinhos,"The wine displays plenty of the warmth of Alentejo while keeping a streak of fresh black currant fruitiness. It's soft, generous and ready to drink.",84,9.0
4283,DFJ Vinhos,"Lightly spicy, this is a soft, off-dry wine. Fresh citrus and apple fruit flavors are perfumed and fruity in the mouth. Not for any aging, it's already a rounded, soft, still fruity wine.",84,9.0
4284,Louis Jadot,"A dense, firm selection, this has layers of red fruits and acids that help to give the wine's skeleton some flesh. This is likely to develop into a rich, but always firm, wine.",88,65.0
4285,Iron Horse,"Pleasant and tasty, this has the raspberry, lime, dough and smoke flavors typical of a fine California sparkling wine. It's a little scoury, especially by the standards of Iron Horse, with a sand­papery roughness to its bubbles. Drink it now, well chilled.",86,38.0
4286,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Polished and structured, it's loaded with fragrant yellow flower, peach, nectarine, white pepper, ginger and mineral sensations that are supported by a backbone of crisp acidity. The lingering finish closes on a note of hazelnut.",89,21.0
4287,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Lovely aromas pour from the glass, a heady mix of lime, Asian pear, cucumber and apple. In the mouth some sweet honey pours over the crisp fruit, and the wine feels lush and perfectly melded, despite its youth. Residual sugar is under 2% and the alcohol just 12%.",88,9.0
4288,Fess Parker,"A big, rich, exuberant Pinot Noir. Floods the mouth with cherry pie, raspberry tart, vanilla and sweet oak flavors that are frankly delicious. It's a bit one-dimensional, but clean and crisp. Best now.",88,50.0
4289,Fess Parker,"This is a big, dense Pinot Noir, and quite a good one, although it's a bit sharp in acidity. Really packs in the black cherry and oak flavors, with a long, red licorice finish, but it's immature, and needs time to come together. Give it 2–3 years.",88,55.0
4290,Fess Parker,"Crisp, clean aromas of Meyer-lemon pith, wet riverstone, cold mountain stream, lemon blossom and petrol show on the nose. The palate is refreshing and straightforward, with light petrol, lemon-lime and red-pear ripeness.",88,24.0
4291,Chanson Père et Fils,"A big, rounded wine, its acidity a foil to the ripe fruit and dusty texture. The structure is chunky and corpulent, the fruit strawberry and red plum fruit packed tightly. It is still integrating, definitely promising some long-term aging.",95,
4292,Louis Jadot,"The tannins set the scene with their firm character and solid structure. Licorice and bitter coffee flavors follow, and only then do the fruits come in. Black cherries are firm and ripe, with black plum skin texture. The wine is very concentrated and powerful. Give it four years or more.",94,
4293,Casa Santos Lima,"Lab (or Labrador Retriever) is the preferred dog of the Santos Lima family. The wine is fresh, citrus flavored and crisply attractive. Acidity, lemon zest and green apples keep the wine really fresh. Drink now.",84,10.0
4294,DFJ Vinhos,"This light wine has crisp raspberry fruits, and lively acidity. It is all fruit with only the lightest texture and very ready to drink now.",84,10.0
4295,Siduri,"This is a well-integrated and beautifully layered wine from a wild, high-elevation vineyard site that provides vibrant acidity and jolts of forested earth. Baked plum and Asian spice form a happy alliance of flavor and intensity along a carpet of velvety texture.",92,49.0
4296,Williams Selyem,"From a vineyard poised along Eastside Road, this wine is juicy in flavor and dense in color and on the palate upon entry. Marked by great, well-defined acidity, it's gorgeously floral in fresh rose petal and orange peel with just a touch of reduction, with an additional weight of black tea and cranberry.",92,58.0
4297,Wines & Winemakers,"This is an off-dry, crisp and fruity wine with lively acidity and an attractive prickle on the tongue. It's a bright wine, as light and bright as possible with citrus flavors bursting from the glass. Drink now.",87,12.0
4298,Casa Santos Lima,"The Algarve, in Portugal's south, is less known for its wines than as a holiday destination. This wine, with its blend of the familiar varieties (also found elsewhere in the country), is structured with red-berry flavors and tannins. The smooth texture and balanced acidity show it is ready to drink now.",87,15.0
4299,Concha y Toro,"Rubbery berry aromas carry a note of vanilla. This feels firm and choppy but not too rough. Rubber, berry fruits and herbal notes define the flavor profile, while the finish is solid in feel, with a minty taste.",86,11.0
4300,Columbia Crest,"It would be hard to find a better $8 Merlot anywhere. This is soft and full-bodied, quite flavorful and fruity, with pretty black cherry fruit. Drinking especially nicely with a bit of bottle age, it finishes with well-proportioned notes of tobacco and clove.",88,8.0
4301,Columbia Crest,"A very fine effort at a most affordable price, this off-dry Gewürztraminer nicely captures the powdery floral scents and peachy, lychee fruit notes of the grape. The bright acidity keeps it fresh and bracing.",88,8.0
4302,Testarossa,"Light, clean and citrusy aromas of lemon, lime and grapefruit skin meet with a dollop of white peach and dusting of crushed slate on the nose of this wine. A fine-pointed acidity carries nectarine, pluot and Asian pear flavors across the palate, which trends racy, bright and slightly sour, with a chalky structure.",93,48.0
4303,Louis Latour,"This stony, mineral wine is still way behind in its development. It is crisp and tight in texture, with refreshing acidity that lifts the white fruits with lime highlights. It's a full wine that will develop well. Drink from 2019.",93,105.0
4304,Louis Latour,"The vineyard is high up the slope, giving this wine that has good acidity and crispness. The acidity is light and bright, while the texture is concentrated and mineral. It is going to develop as a fine, ripe wine. Drink from 2018.",93,95.0
4305,Albert Bichot,"This is full and fruity with great swathes of smoky tannins. Structured and concentrated, it promises a good future. Strawberry and red-plum flavors are there, along with the darker tannic element. Drink from 2019.",93,55.0
4306,Williams Selyem,"This unusual and attention-getting wine is full of spicy aromas and flavors, almost like a mulled wine, with cinnamon, clove and cardamom, plus a super-concentrated fruit core. The texture stays tangy despite the heavy spices, and the mouthfeel is very assertive and appetizing.",91,65.0
4307,Fess Parker,"From the renowned vineyard's F Block comes a wine with plump wild berries, pencil lead and juniper on a tightly woven nose. Certain to last for years and evolve steadily over that time, the palate now shows lavender, elderberry, elderflower, cranberry essence and a touch of black tea. Drink 2018–2028.",90,55.0
4308,Fess Parker,"Dark strawberry fruit meets with rustic earthy aromas and light allspice notes on the nose of this wine from the late actor's family-owned winery. The palate shows boisterous and tart cranberry and black raspberry fruit, with pencil lead minerality and great energy, if not a ton of complexity.",90,55.0
4309,Kunde,"Tropical and fleshy with upfront acidity, this wine has a full-bodied richness on the nose and overtone, despite a more light-bodied midpalate and finish. Along the way, lemony brightness mingles with a taste of yellow apple.",88,18.0
4310,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"At 160g/L residual sugar, this late-harvest wine brings plenty of sweetness with its lightly spritzy marmalade, orange peel and pear aromas and flavors, yet it still retains an appealing sense of lightness and balance as well. The length is impressive.",91,40.0
4311,Chehalem,"Another fine white wine from Chehalem, dry but not sour, with lovely sweet/tart peach and pear, honeysuckle and lime flavors co-mingled. It has a full midpalate and a clean, refreshing finish.",92,21.0
4312,Concha y Toro,"Intense and compact on the nose, this has cola, mint, cassis and blackberry aromas that are tightly knit. The palate is narrow and intense, with lightly herbal, reedy flavors of saucy, savory berry and herb. This is a leading Carmenère, but it's not as flavorful and substantive as prior years.",90,149.0
4313,Chehalem,"This is a forward, even plush Reserve, loaded with generous black fruits and streaked with anise and cola notes. At first, the wine seemed to fade a bit too quickly, robbing the finish of expected complexity. But retasted on the second day, the wine had fleshed out beautifully.",90,59.0
4314,Concha y Toro,"An opening of dense black-fruit, spice, violet and toast aromas functions as an invitation to this plump, chunky, well-balanced Cabernet Sauvignon. The palate bears boysenberry, blackberry and cassis flavors, with chocolate and molasses accents. Toasty, warm and rich on the finish. Drink now–2016.",90,22.0
4315,Iron Horse,"The blend is Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. The Brut X designation refers to the winery's driest sparkler, but the wine retains plenty of sweet, ripe strawberries, raspberries, limes, vanilla and honey. It's very good, but a minor critique is a certain roughness of texture. Drink now.",88,50.0
4316,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"This is a crisp, clean and nicely-structured Chardonnay, fermented in a mix of new and neutral oak, along with some stainless steel. A bit beer-like and yeasty at first, it opens into pleasing flavors of grapefruit and pineapple, with just the right amount of acidity.",88,11.0
4317,Columbia Crest,"Fermented in concrete, then aged on lees for five months, this is a pretty expression of Chardonnay with popcorn butter, cream and white peach leading to a tart finish.",88,20.0
4318,Wines & Winemakers,"A typical off-dry wine, lightly spritzy and with just enough acidity to balance. The fruit is the thing. The low alcohol makes it a fine summer wine. Drink now.",84,10.0
4319,DFJ Vinhos,The smooth flavors of Fernão Pires make this wine. They give a ripe character of whisked cream and apples. The wine is totally ready to drink.,84,9.0
4320,DFJ Vinhos,The wine is crisp and as light as a feather. The fruitiness brings with it apple and pink grapefruit as well as warmer golden plums and a perfumed aftertaste. Drink the wine now.,84,9.0
4321,Santa Ema,"Jammy and concentrated on the nose, but more sharp and citric than ideal in the mouth. The wine is borderline sharp, with sour cherry and cranberry flavors leading to a tart, zesty finish. Tastes sour every time you revisit it.",84,12.0
4322,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"This vineyard is at the heart of the fine run of premier crus that lie midway up the slope above the village. This wine is packed with fruit and also with intense acidity and minerality. It is already refreshing and crisp, although as the toastiness develops, it will become even more impressive. Drink from 2017.",93,128.0
4323,Louis Latour,"This is a solid wine with its dark tannins and structure from a vineyard close to some of the greatest Grands Crus. It is concentrated, showing the density of the appellation. There is a basic richness to this wine with its ripe black fruits. It is developing slowly and has a fine future. Drink from 2022.",93,135.0
4324,DFJ Vinhos,"This producer is the only grower of Caladoc grapes in Portugal, and one of the few in the world. Blended here with Tinta Roriz, the grape gives a ripe, soft and perfumed wine. It has a generous character, all fruit and balanced acidity. Drink now.",85,10.0
4325,Wines & Winemakers,"A dry style of Vinho Verde, this is crisp and cool. Slight petillance adds a lift, brightening the citrus flavors and acidity. Drink now.",85,12.0
4326,Lynmar,"This is a classically light rosé, fragrant in strawberry and raspberry. Traces of pomegranate on the back palate offers darker, riper fruit in the glass, getting prettier as it goes along. Deliciously dry and dancing in acidity, it has plenty of citrus on the finish. The wine is substantial enough for springtime and summertime meals, but will drink equally well on its own.",92,20.0
4327,Maryhill,The medium-sweet stone-fruit and orange-peel flavors are direct and bring appeal. It goes down easy.,86,14.0
4328,Montes,"Red in color, with non-punchy aromas of strawberry and red apple. It feels heavy and thick, with red fruit flavors that don't bring enough refreshment to the glass.",82,13.0
4329,Gary Farrell,"Impressively juicy waves of cranberry and black tea underlie a light, earthy and ethereal wine from a well-known vineyard known for its meticulous farming. Dried herbs and roses add to the complexity and savory nature of this beauty.",94,55.0
4330,Gary Farrell,"From the Pellegrini Olivet Lane Vineyard on Olivet Road, this wine is impressive and memorable, a true star of winemaking and region. Beautiful in color, it begins with a touch of reductive oak and butter, with a squeeze of lemon foreshadowing things to come. Big-boned, it shines in pear, tangerine and a tangle of tangy acidity.",94,45.0
4331,Lynmar,"This estate beauty offers a depth of cola spice and lovely acidity, with just a hint of underlying richness. From a site that's slightly more coastal than the vineyards around the producer's winery, it shows savory characteristics of rhubarb and wild strawberry amid a plushness of forest, all within supportive, integrated oak.",94,65.0
4332,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Made with the native grape Aglianico, this fantastic, lightly hued sparkler offers aromas of Spanish broom, acacia, woodland berry, red apple and Mediterranean herbs. The firm, intense palate delivers wild cherry, raspberry, citrus zest and bread crust Notes of bay leaf and thyme ride alongside a refined, persistent perlage.",92,43.0
4333,Kendall-Jackson,"Whatever the Jackson family does in Santa Maria works quite well, including this wine. The wondrous nose shows chives, exotic pears, mandarin pith, sesame seeds, a touch of smoke and chalky grip. On the palate, flavors recall fried green apple peels, lemon juice, quince, star fruit and lemon pith.",92,28.0
4334,Testarossa,"A splendid Syrah, black in color, dry, tannic, acidic and rich in blackberry, currant, grilled meat, black pepper and toasty oak flavors that are incredibly complex and satisfying. Testarossa has a great history with this bottling, and while the wine doesn't have the immediately dazzling luxuriousness of the 2007, it's more ageable. Drink after 2016.",92,56.0
4335,Williams Selyem,"With ample power under its engine, this Ferrington Vineyard Pinot is rich in cranberry and red cherry, soft and lilting in texture yet nuanced in toasty oak. Big on the finish, it'll beautifully withstand a few more years on its own before opening, the acidity lively enough to keep flavors vibrant yet mellowed.",92,65.0
4336,V. Sattui,"Give this Zin extra points for sheer power. The vineyard consists of two parcels in St. Helena that date to the 1930s or earlier. It's a tremendous wine, dry, full-bodied and strong in alcohol, with blackberry, blueberry, red currant, licorice, black pepper and cedar flavors.",92,39.0
4337,Testarossa,"This is a generous, tightly wound vineyard-designate that tastes more full-figured than it lists in terms of alcohol, jammy in dark plum and cardamom. It finishes with a ripe robustness of dark cherry fruit flavor and hint of earth.",88,64.0
4338,V. Sattui,"This wine—sold direct only through the winery —gets better with time, with stony, cherry and cardamom brightening up through the tannins as the wine has a chance to breathe. Big and full, V. Sattui gets its grapes from mostly Lake County, rounding it out with a smaller percentage of Napa Valley fruit, as well as a handful from Dry Creek. Very solid.",88,26.0
4339,Georges Duboeuf,"Rounded and rich wine, its acidity pushing through firm tannins and lively red fruits. There are both freshness and structure here, with final juiciness.",88,16.0
4340,Williams Selyem,"Sweetly attractive in raspberry and cherry jam flavors that are bright and zesty, while smoky oak brings spicy-sweet notes of vanilla bean and buttered cinnamon toast. Despite all the sheer lusciousness, this Pinot finishes dry. Drink now.",88,39.0
4341,Iron Horse,"Easily as good as the winery's more expensive proprietary bottlings, this shows classic Russian River acidity and minerality, with flavors of tropical fruits, tangerines, golden apricots and limes. It's really rich, but classically dry, with a long, distinguished finish.",93,28.0
4342,Iron Horse,"Beautiful, classic Green Valley Chardonnay, this shows bright, mouthwatering acidity and a steely minerality that make it savory and elegant. But there's also a deep, flavorful core of green apple butter, pineapple jam and orange-mango juice. Oak and lees aging lend a creamy, sourdough richness. Drink now.",93,48.0
4343,Montes,"This is concentrated and stout on the nose, with roasted black-fruit aromas bolstered by coconut, tobacco and cool-earth accents. The palate is thick, rich and layered with black fruit extract and tannin, bearing flavors of dark plum, baked blackberry, savory spice and BBQ sauce. It's smooth, deep and long on the finish, with notes of coffee, vanilla and mocha. A monster wine with class. Drink now through 2018.",93,100.0
4344,Chateau Ste. Michelle,Aromas of honeysuckle and ripe peach lead to lightly spritzy medium-sweet stone-fruit flavors. It provides easy-drinking appeal.,88,9.0
4345,Santa Ema,"At first the nose is scattered, offering iodine and Italian herbs but little fruit. In the mouth, blackberries appear. The finish is a bit like coffee. This wine has some character and appeal but also some fading characteristics. Maybe this 1998, never a great year, is just too old.",85,28.0
4346,Concha y Toro,"Ripe and ready, with powerful dark fruit. This is a fine “starter” Cab from Chile and Concha y Toro, one that will impress novices and satisfy the high-end drinker as well. The palate is slightly sugary, but the black fruit is ripe and tasty. And the tannins are there, as they should be, although they're not overwhelming. Best Buy.",85,8.0
4347,Louis Jadot,"Vines from a number of growers on the lower slopes of Gevrey-Chambertin contribute to this wine. It has the plentiful tannins typical of the village yet also exudes attractive juicy red fruit. It will need another year or two to show its best, so drink from 2019.",90,69.0
4348,Louis Jadot,"This wine from the most northerly of the Côte d'Or appellations is a blend from multiple growers. It has red cherry and plum fruit with a fresh streak, typical of the vintage. Underlying firm tannins will sustain it as it ages. Drink from 2018.",90,39.0
4349,Wines & Winemakers,"This perfumed old-vine field blend is rich and stylish. It has weight without power, a fine combination of lively red fruit and firm tannins, and will age well for years. Drink from 2019.",90,14.0
4350,Wines & Winemakers,"As the name suggests, only 10 barrels of this rich expression of Alvarinho were produced. It has crisp acidity, ripe apple and apricot flavors and just a hint of the wood. An ageworthy white that will be better from 2018.",90,75.0
4351,Louis Latour,"For a Grand Cru from Vosne-Romanée, this is a wine on the light side, its tannins soft and dominated by new-wood flavors. That said, it is still a fine wine, packed with ripe fruit and fresh acidity. The structure floats over the fruit; a few months and it may fatten out.",91,350.0
4352,Georges Duboeuf,"Rich as well as tannic, this is concentrated, with dense fruits and sweet acidity. Its structure offers good aging as well as pleasurable fruit now.",91,
4353,Kendall-Jackson,"Superb, opulent, just wonderful. Hard to exaggerate the beauty of this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon. Fantastically ripe and rich in black cherries, currants, sandalwood and spices, with a grounding streak of herbs. Beyond the flavors is the near-perfect structure, marked by smooth, complex tannins. Finishes sweet but completely dry, the paradox of a great wine. Drink now–2015.",96,70.0
4354,Chehalem,"This one-of-a-kind offering from Chehalem celebrates what they are calling a “great” vintage. The wine is dark, supple and immensely rich and dense, yet retains a lightness that captures the elegance of the Pinot Noir grape while propelling it to rarified heights. The mix of red and purple fruits, herb, spice and earth all come together in a smooth and seductive wine that drinks like a dream.",95,99.0
4355,Santa Ema,"The nose starts out herbal and rowdy, but then settles down to offer basic pear and apple aromas. The palate is all pineapple and other racy fruits, but it's also sweet and a bit discordant. The long, driving finish doesn't really hit the mark, and it's a bit heavy and drying right through the last impression.",83,9.0
4356,Casa Santos Lima,"From a small sub-region of Lisboa, this stylish, structured wine is firm and tannic. It has plenty of ripe berry fruit to balance the tannins as well as acidity that cuts through the richness of the wine. It is ready to drink.",90,11.0
4357,Maryhill,"Sweet and jammy fruit flavors suggest canned cherry and plum. That sweetness is offset by the drying, earthy tannins and flavor of dried herb.",87,30.0
4358,Chehalem,"Bursting with ripe apple scents and flavors, this is dry and ready to enjoy. Fermented in a mix of neutral barrel and stainless steel, it starts off sharp and assertive but mellows into pleasing roundness on the midpalate. Drink now and over the next year or two while it's at its freshest.",88,25.0
4359,Robert Mondavi,"Lots of elegance in this Cabernet. It's dry, full bodied and rich in tannins, with a good depth of black currants and sweet, toasty oak. Won't age, but who cares: Pop the cork and drink it now.",89,28.0
4360,Louis Latour,"Toasty aromas go through to the palate, highlighting the wood aging. It is tense, mineral, packed with apple and lemon acidity. The aftertaste is equally crisp and bright.",87,23.0
4361,Kendall-Jackson,"A big but mild-mannered wine, this has subtle oak and butter aromas plus ripe pear, butterscotch and white-peach flavors. A nicely thick texture carries all the complexity through the finish.",89,17.0
4362,V. Sattui,Reduced and extracted aromas burn off over time to unveil a full-bodied expression of juicy red fruit and cedar that opens in the glass. It finishes in tea and leather.,89,39.0
4363,Concha y Toro,"The source for this wine is now Limarí, and it offers plenty of barrel toast to go with stemmy apple and peach aromas. There's a lot of acidity here, so expect racy, almost sour citrus and apple flavors in front of a long, aggressive finish.",86,19.0
4364,DFJ Vinhos,"A soft and creamy wine, freshened with a little citrus. It has only light acidity, the main focus being pear and red apple flavors. It rolls easily around the palate, finishing freshly. Screwcap.",84,6.0
4365,Williams Selyem,"Although this is the least costly of the winery's Pinots, it's a lovely wine. Blending from a vast source of vineyards has given winemaker Cabral the ability to fill in divots of every kind. Gentle and dry, this rich, complex Pinot Noir has the elegance and style you expect from Williams Selyem.",92,34.0
4366,Kendall-Jackson,"This blend of Monterey and Santa Barbara county vineyards offers fresh aromas of lemon-lime soda, chives and a hint of smoke. The palate is framed around sour-sweet green apple, with more bitterness and tension coming from green pear flesh and citrus pith.",88,22.0
4367,DFJ Vinhos,"This is soft and juicy with just a hint of a more tannic structure in the background. It is designed as an immediate easy-drinking wine, full of fruit and blackberry fruits.",85,10.0
4368,DFJ Vinhos,"This is a bold, ripe wine from the heart of the Alentejo. Perfumed, full of red berry flavored fruits and with a rich, soft texture, it is ready to drink.",85,9.0
4369,DFJ Vinhos,"With some wood aging in French oak, the wine seems to have smoothed out the fruitiness. It is soft with a light spice and hints of green apple. The wine is ready to drink.",85,15.0
4370,Testarossa,"This wine, from one of the coolest parts of the Russian River Valley, has hints of the mushroomy earthiness that plagues some 2011 Pinot Noirs. But for whatever reason (good viticulture and careful sorting are likely), that slight unripeness remains only in the background as a complex counter to the tart cranberries, cherries and cola. The wine is marked by dryness and bright acidity. Surely it wants some time in the bottle. Drink after 2017.",91,60.0
4371,Testarossa,"This Pinot has everything going for it. It's dry and tart in acidity, with a silky texture, yet rich in raspberries, cola, mint and sandalwood. It's not one of Testarossa's more expensive single-vineyard wines, but it's close to them, with a classic evocation of coastal Pinot Noir.",91,42.0
4372,Testarossa,"Exceptionally ripe tropical fruit, citrus and apricot flavors combine with oak to produce this rich, opulent Chardonnay. It's brisk in acidity and modest in alcohol, giving it true elegance. Drink it now with tuna, shrimp, scallop and other rich foods that go with Chardonnay.",91,41.0
4373,Testarossa,"Rich and creamy in pineapple, orange and lime fruit, with a sweet coating of new oak, this Chardonnay is balanced with zesty acidity. It's an opulent, flashy wine.",90,41.0
4374,Testarossa,"Rich and ripe in tropical fruit, apricot and peach flavors, this oaky Chardonnay is brightened by crisp acidity. The oakiness returns in the finish, which suggests buttered toast. Drink now.",90,41.0
4375,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"This vineyard-designated Merlot includes 14% Cabernet Sauvignon. This vintage, Syrah is eliminated and alcohol is lowered—a welcome shift. Rich and loaded with black fruits, it carries interesting accents of caramel popcorn, yielding a delicious, tongue-coating wine with a silky-smooth mouthfeel. It has good length, and the possibility of aging for another five or six years.",90,26.0
4376,Columbia Crest,Light aromas of apple and pear lead to broad dry flavors. It delivers easy-drinking appeal.,86,12.0
4377,Concha y Toro,"Blackened spice aromas are affixed to blackberry and herbal scents on this full-bodied, saturated Maipo Syrah. In the mouth, this is big in every way, with bolstering acidity. Flavors of black plum, boysenberry and tomato bring spice and herbal notes into play, while the finish is juicy but not overly long, with notes of herbs, spice and oaky vanilla. Drink through 2020.",92,150.0
4378,Fess Parker,"A bit tight and funky on the nose with damp mushrooms and juniper notes spicing up the black-cherry fruit, this clonal study by winemaker Blair Fox is a great eye-opener for wine geeks. The palate packs shiitake and porcini flavors with basil, bay leaf, oregano and black-pepper spice, laid across black-plum fruit and soy-sauce richness.",92,55.0
4379,Undurraga,"Tropical aromas rise up and win you over. Bold and citrusy in the mouth, with crisp lime, green apple, grapefruit and passion fruit flavors. Zesty and remaining fruity until the end. A ripe, fresh, familiar wine done right.",88,12.0
4380,Siduri,"Ripe raspberry juice is spiced heavily with cloves rendered in butter and flashes of black pepper on this wine by Adam Lee. It's fresh and flavorful on the powerful palate, with lots of black spice, vibrant berry juice and fresh thyme on the edges. This wine is alive with energy and verve.",93,55.0
4381,Williams Selyem,"This full-bodied, well-oaked wine offers vanilla, coconut, cinnamon and red cherry aromas that meet tart cranberry, strawberry, nutmeg and cream flavors. It's expansive, well balanced, spicy and delicious and will taste best after 2020.",94,58.0
4382,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"The nose is most restrained: the slightest notions of jasmine and nettle appear. With more air, a faint hint of orange peel emerges. The palate is one of streamlined slenderness and precision. This is like a dry laser beam festooned with honeysuckle blossom and fresh lemon zest. There is something that draws you ever deeper into stone and citrus. The lightness of the dry palate remains simply astonishing.",94,65.0
4383,Montes,"Lime, mineral and green herbs combine to create a nice aromatic opening. The palate is juicy and healthy, with flavors of jalapeño, lime and green apple. Finishes solid and quite long for a basic SB. Well made and tasty.",88,12.0
4384,DFJ Vinhos,"A black, solid wine, spiced heavily with wood but still showing blackberry flavors, textured with plum skins. The wine feels warm and ripe, finishing with black cherries and lingering softness.",90,13.0
4385,Wines & Winemakers,"Fernão Pires with Sauvignon Blanc allows the second grape's herbal nature to shine. So it is crisp, citrusy and with intense acidity. The wine has a ripe feel with hints of tropical fruit at the end. Drink now.",85,15.0
4386,Santa Ema,"Vegetal-leaning aromas of beans, peas and squash lead to a round somewhat flabby palate. Green, herbal flavors crowd out mild citrus and melon notes in front of a low-acid soft finish.",85,24.0
4387,Montes,"Tight, pure blackberry and cassis aromas are composed. This is a better-balanced wine than the sticky, overly oaked 2012 version. Leading toasty chocolate flavors go well with secondary spiced berry and cassis notes. A note of vanilla comes out on the finish.",91,17.0
4388,V. Sattui,"Fresh, vibrant and tangy, this is a great example of a dry light-bodied but very appetizing wine. Canteloupe and peach aromas lead to citrus and raspberry flavors that are lean but tasty. It's one of the best California Sangiovese rosés.",90,26.0
4389,Gary Farrell,"A 100% varietal wine from the famed Ritchie Vineyard, this is a tremendous expression of elusively sublime lemon and lime, with a juiciness of grapefruit. Crisp and refreshing from start to finish, it offers complex, creamy Tahitian vanilla bean midway through, finishing with zest.",91,28.0
4390,Kendall-Jackson,"This softly appealing Syrah has pie-filling flavors of cherries and blackberries, with cinnamon spice, brown sugar and baked crust overtones. It's a dry, interesting wine that belies its everyday price.",86,12.0
4391,Casa Santos Lima,"The Moscatel in this blend is what gives this soft wine its perfumed character. It is fruity, bright and open with light acidity and a gentle texture. Drink now.",85,10.0
4392,Casa Santos Lima,"A pale colored rosé, light and attractively crisp. Soft red fruits come through the gentle texture to give a wine that is ripe, fruity and ready to drink.",85,10.0
4393,DFJ Vinhos,"Paxis is a warm, earthy wine, packed with ripe, soft and forward fruit. It does have a structure that could allow the wine to age, but there is no need as its fruitiness makes it ready to drink now.",88,9.0
4394,Testarossa,"Acidity and mushroom and earth notes combine to mute the fresh fruits in this Chardonnay. It's rich in apricots, oranges and peaches, enhanced by oak, but has a dry, austere tug that suggests brief cellaring. Drink after 2016.",89,41.0
4395,Testarossa,"This tasty Pinot is one of Testarossa's more forward wines from the 2011 vintage. It shows the delicacy of texture and mouthwatering acidity that characterize all the wines, with candied flavors of raspberry, blueberry, mint and cola, enriched, as always, by lucious, smoky oak. It may be that the vines need some more age, for the underlying terroir seems fine.",89,60.0
4396,Testarossa,"This delicious Chardonnay combines brisk acidity and ripe tropical fruit and oak flavors, resulting in a rich wine. What it lacks in complexity it makes up for in opulence.",89,41.0
4397,Columbia Crest,"Hand harvested from Block 15 of StoneTree Vineyard with a dollop of Cabernet Sauvignon from Block 14 (10%), it brings notes of coffee, cocoa and plum. The fruit flavors are elegant in style accented by barrel notes and mouthwatering acids. It doesn't seem to have fully reached its potential yet, with the tannins bringing a slightly gritty feel.",89,30.0
4398,Foxen,"With 15% alcohol by volume, this is the headiest of Foxen's new 2011 reds. A blend of Grenache and Mourvèdre, it's fruity almost to the point of sweetness in raspberries and cherries, but turns dry and crisp on the finish. A delightful red wine to drink now with almost anything, and you can even put a little chill on it.",89,44.0
4399,DFJ Vinhos,"Part of a series that aims to express the character of a grape, this is a convincing interpretation of a fickle variety. It has red berry fruits, lit with acidity and with gentle tannins. Touches of spice from wood aging add interest without masking the fruit. Drink the wine now.",88,15.0
4400,DFJ Vinhos,"Both grapes in this blend have gathered the natural freshness of the region, close to the ocean. This crisp wine is tightly textured with a ripe yellow and white fruit flavor. Drink this wine from 2017.",88,10.0
4401,Columbia Crest,"This is predominantly Merlot, with Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah filling out the blend. As with many of the H3 wines, vanilla is the strongest and most noticeable flavor. The fruit is compact, and it tastes like hard cherry candy. There is plenty of power, but not much subtlety.",87,15.0
4402,DFJ Vinhos,"Full-bodied, spicy wine. It has a ripe, toast and apple flavor and a smooth texture, with light acidity. The wine is dry while also soft.",86,9.0
4403,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Mature black-skinned berry, ripe plum, menthol, leather and tobacco are just some of the aromas that emerge on this full-bodied red. The firm, spicy palate delivers dried black cherry, blackberry, ground pepper, clove, espresso and licorice alongside a backbone of youthfully assertive but refined tannins. Give it time to fully develop. Drink 2020–2035.",93,65.0
4404,Iron Horse,"A mere 40 cases of this LD exists, a lucky find in the cellar laid down in 2001 and forgotten about until this year. A blend of 60% Pinot Noir and 40% Chardonnay, it's fragrant in dried fruit and boasts a thick, unctuous mouthfeel. Briny, dry and tart, with the taste of fresh-squeezed lemon, it's a philosophical exercise in the art of patience.",93,110.0
4405,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Intense violet, dark berry, ground pepper and a whiff of leather are some of the aromas you'll discover in this radiant wine. Concentrated and delicious, the palate brings flavors of blackberry, black cherry, clove and tobacco, while fresh acidity and velvety tannins provide balance. Soft but structured, it's already tempting, but wait a few more years for added depth.",93,23.0
4406,Montes,"Aromas of spice, vanilla and wood are stronger than this wine's fruit scents. Pure and lush on the palate, this is showing fine balance. Flavors of baking spices, caramel, vanilla and black fruits finish mildly and subtly, with mocha notes and good length. Drink this ripe Cabernet blend through 2019.",93,300.0
4407,Lynmar,"From a myriad of wonderful vineyards, this vibrant wine offers an incredible deal at the price, with a lively bouquet of fennel, apple and pear. Chalky in texture with delicious acidity, it has baking spices popping up on balanced finish.",90,30.0
4408,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Barrel aromas are at the fore, with notes of vanilla, cocoa and milk chocolate out in front of blackberry and black cherry. The palate also mixes fruit and barrel, showing pleasing depth of flavors and intensity along with a silky texture.",90,18.0
4409,Columbia Crest,"Aromas of butter, vanilla, corn silk and tropical fruit lead to barrel-forward, oak-laden pineapple flavors that intertwine through the finish. For the style, it's well done but the oak is pretty intense.",90,26.0
4410,Columbia Crest,"The aromas are exuberant, with notes of lime, orange zest, ripe peach and flowers. The palate, as advertised, is bone dry with stone-fruit flavors that show crystalline clarity and linger on the finish that features plenty of lime accents.",90,28.0
4411,Siduri,"Eucalyptus, Bay laurel and other herbal aromas dominate the nose of this wine, making way for black tea and cola flavors. Full-bodied and robustly ripe with powerful tannin, it's ultimately earthy and complex.",90,55.0
4412,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Soft and ripe, with fruit flavors that border on raisin and prune, this nicely bottle-aged Merlot is good to go right now. In fact, it could pass for an older wine, or perhaps a nonvintage blend; it's smooth and mature, with good balance and very soft tannins.",86,16.0
4413,Foxen,"A good wine, with some noble features such as perfect tannins and wonderfully fresh acidity. But, good as it is, there's something off in the taste. Too jammy, too fruity, with a candied, raspberry granola sweetness, lacking depth and the brooding, earthy layers you want in a Pinot this expensive.",87,52.0
4414,Trapiche,"Baked and broad on the nose, with toasty aromas, marshmallow sweetness and floral hints. The palate is tight, healthy and tastes of savory, meaty fruit including black cherry and wild raspberry. Leather and herbal notes work the finish, and overall this is nice but more basic than complex.",87,17.0
4415,Kendall-Jackson,"A solid Cabernet, offering plenty of savory blackberry, cola and spice flavors that finish dry and wholesome.",87,28.0
4416,Wines & Winemakers,"This crisp, clean and ripe wine is finely balanced. The toastiness from wood aging in new barrels is balanced with the rich citrus and sliced apple and a tight, mineral character. This is a full-bodied wine needing a few more months to age. Drink from 2018.",89,18.0
4417,Chehalem,"Light and forward, this pleasant, single vineyard selection opens with pretty raspberry and black cherry fruit and an impression of spritziness. The flavors suggest Campari, with light streaks of herb and anise.",88,50.0
4418,Chehalem,"There's some muscle and meat to this tight young wine, with black raspberry and cherry fruits. But those flavors feel squeezed by the chalky sour-lemon acidity, which may or may not soften with additional bottle age.",88,50.0
4419,Williams Selyem,"From the historic vineyard site surrounded by Pinot Noir, this wine makes the case for variety and heritage, coaxing bright acidity and floral aromatics out of the grapes. Full bodied, its flavors combine plum, raisin cake, dried cranberry and dust into a leathery whole, finishing in chocolate cinnamon.",93,65.0
4420,Trapiche,"Full of red-fruit aromas, particularly plum and cherry. Feels raw, with wild berry, ample oak and a lot of acid-based tang to the palate. Lightly toasty, with a mild cherry flavor to the finish.",84,10.0
4421,Columbia Crest,"Generous and aromatic,  this flavorful Merlot is a showcase for ripe black cherry fruit, accented with strong streaks of vanilla and tobacco. The plush, dark fruit leads into a tasty, toasty finish, with notes of licorice and smoke.",90,12.0
4422,Concha y Toro,"The 2012 vintage was so hot in Chile that harvests came very early. Thus finding mature, complex SBs in this year won't be easy. This perennially excellent wine is as good as you'll find in 2012. Scallion, lime and other green aromas precede a zesty, hard-driving palate. Sea shell, grapefruit, lime and chervil flavors set up a tight, minerally finish.",90,30.0
4423,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"Classically powerful and rich, this is a concentrated wine. With spice from the wood aging prominent, it is still young. That spice is balanced by the ripe yellow and baked-apple fruits. The aftertaste has delicious flavors of honey and lemon. Drink this wine from 2020.",93,235.0
4424,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"With spice and layers of wood aging over the black-cherry fruit, this is a wine in progress. It has the bright character of the vintage, full of acidity and with the potential of great fruitiness. From the Vergennes sub-section of the Corton Grand Cru, it has a good future. Drink from 2021.",93,170.0
4425,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"A level portion of this premier cru, called Les Plateaux, is the origin of this wine. As befits a wine from Nuits Saint-Georges, it is dark with tannins as well as fruit. It has a good structure, with dense blackberry and plum flavors that are developing. Give this wine until 2022.",93,101.0
4426,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"This vineyard is at the heart of the fine run of premier crus that lie midway up the slope above the village. This wine is packed with fruit and also with intense acidity and minerality. It is already refreshing and crisp, although as the toastiness develops, it will become even more impressive. Drink from 2017.",93,128.0
4427,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Coming from the warm 2012 vintage, the notes vary from stone fruit, such as apricot, into tropical with dried pineapple. Aged in a mixture of stainless steel and older French oak barrels, it's fresh and appealing while also displaying some weight and density, drinking quite dry with a tart finish.",87,18.0
4428,Chanson Père et Fils,"This is wood laden, with sweet fruit that compensates for the toastiness. The oak element should integrate well in the next 2–3 years, making for a wine that's soft and sweetly fruity, with smoky acidity.",89,39.0
4429,Louis Latour,"Soft, ripe and rich, this is very easy on the palate. The wine does have good depth of flavor from the rounded black cherry flavors, the fruit almost sweet in its openness. It is already delicious.",89,65.0
4430,Louis Latour,"Concentrated, with dark tannins to go with the ripe fruit. There is a tough edge to the wine, although it is more accessible than some Nuits-Saint-Georges at this stage.",89,115.0
4431,Chanson Père et Fils,"Aromas of ripe yellow fruits announce a wine that has rich fruit flavors of apricots touched by pineapple. It does have the attractive, nervy texture of 2008, along with an important layer of toast.",89,65.0
4432,Bründlmayer,"Bründlmayer makes a particularly felicitous brut, crisp, yeasty, with very pure green and white fruits. It has an intense minerality, tight, structured and finishing with great waves of toast. The wine spends three years on its lees, which shows in its density of flavor.",91,46.0
4433,Bründlmayer,"You can feel the unctuous, oily richness as soon as this wine reaches the tongue. It is dense and concentrated, with sweet green plums and a creamy texture. The old-vine fruit, enveloping the mouth, just leaves a hint of spice.",91,54.0
4434,Bründlmayer,"Smooth, creamy aromas are followed by a rich, concentrated mouthful, with spice showing through the green berry fruits, apples and cream flavors. This tastes warm, inviting, with yellow fruits adding an exotic element in the aftertaste.",91,32.0
